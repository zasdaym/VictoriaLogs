The following `tip` changes can be tested by building VictoriaLogs components from the latest commit of [VictoriaLogs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/) repository
according to the following docs:

* [How to build VictoriaLogs from source code](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/quickstart/#building-from-source-code)
* [How to build vlagent from source code](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#building-from-source-code)

## tip

* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add an option to customize the favicon color. This makes it easier to distinguish between different installations opened in multiple browser tabs. See [#1634](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1634).

* BUGFIX: [cluster version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/): evenly spread rerouted data across available `vlstorage` nodes. Previously, healthy nodes adjacent to unavailable nodes in the `-storageNode` list could receive much more data, resulting in uneven resource usage. See [#1548](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1548).
* BUGFIX: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/) and [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/): properly handle logs containing duplicate [stream field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) names. Previously, [v1.52.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.52.0) could panic when ingesting such logs in single-node VictoriaLogs, drop them during ingestion in VictoriaLogs cluster, or panic when querying such data written by earlier releases. See [#1603](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1603) and [#1604](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1604).

## [v1.52.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.52.0)

Released at 2026-07-16

**Update note 1:** the base Docker image has been changed from [Alpine](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) to [distroless](https://github.com/googlecontainertools/distroless) in order to reduce an attack surface (The `distroless` base image doesn't contain any executables contrary to the Alpine base image). For debugging VictoriaLogs containers in Kubernetes it is recommended to use [`kubectl debug`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_debug/).

**Update note 2:** VictoriaLogs no longer provides a Docker image for the `linux/386` platform because the `distroless` base image [doesn't support this platform](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/issues/881). Executable files for `linux/386` platform are still published at [the VictoriaLogs releases page](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases).

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.26.4 to Go1.26.5. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.26.5](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.26.5%20label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* FEATURE: switch base Docker image from [Alpine](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) to [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/) for VictoriaLogs, `vlagent` and `vlogscli`. This reduces the image size and attack surface. See [#1228](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1228).
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add [`json_array_concat` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#json_array_concat-pipe) for joining JSON array items stored in the given [log field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) into a string with the given delimiter. See [#712](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/712).
* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): adjust [`_stream` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) value according to the actual log fields. This simplifies importing of previously modified VictoriaLogs-exported data. See [#1122](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1122).
* FEATURE: [vlagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/): add `-remoteWrite.basicAuth.usernameFile` command-line flag for dynamically reloading basic auth username for the corresponding `-remoteWrite.url` from the given file. See [operator#2371](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/operator/issues/2371).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): improve hits chart tooltip timestamp display by hiding excessive precision. See [#1533](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1533).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add Quick start examples to autocomplete suggestions and show recent query history items alongside field and value suggestions. See [#1498](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1498).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): persist query history in browser local storage and show the last run time for history items. See [#1498](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1498).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): improve hits chart interval selector by using curated interval options and choosing a more suitable default step for the selected time range. See [#1511](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1511).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): sync grouping in raw logs panel with Hits chart. Raw Logs are no longer grouped by `_stream` by default, and both panels now use the same `Group by` setting. See [#1534](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1534).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): persist the selected auto-refresh interval in the URL. See [#1310](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1310).

* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): fix panic when using [`uniq_values()`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#uniq_values-stats) in the [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe) in VictoriaLogs cluster when some `vlstorage` nodes return no values for the requested field while other `vlstorage` nodes return values for the same group. See [#1383](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1383).
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): properly select the top `N` log entries in the [`json_values`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#json_values-stats) stats function with `sort by (...) limit N` when more than `N` logs match per group. Previously an arbitrary subset of the matching logs could be returned instead of the top `N` ones. The returned entries were correctly sorted, but they could be the wrong entries. See [#1311](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1311).
* BUGFIX: [syslog data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/): avoid stamping [RFC3164](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3164) messages received right after the new year with the previous year (which could drop them under a short `-retentionPeriod`), and compute the year in `-syslog.timezone` instead of the server local timezone. See [#1556](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1556).
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): fix [`field_names` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#field_names-pipe) not respecting [`hidden_fields_filters`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#hidden-fields). Fields listed in `hidden_fields_filters` still appeared in `field_names` output, leaking their existence to the caller. See [#1574](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1574/).
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): fix a `vlselect` crash in [cluster mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/) on some valid queries. This happened when a [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe) operand had the same name as a function (such as `abs`, `round` or `floor`), or when `from` was used as a separator in the [`split` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#split-pipe). See [#1518](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1518).
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): allow [`filter` pipes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filter-pipe) without the `filter` prefix when the filter starts with a non-word token or the `not` keyword, such as `... | !foo`, `... | {host="x"}`, `... | >5`, `... | =foo` or `... | not foo`. These were unintentionally rejected with `unexpected pipe` in [v1.51.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.51.0). A non-word token (and the `not` operator) cannot clash with a pipe name, so it is unambiguously a filter. See [#1522](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1522).
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): reject `field*` wildcards in the comma-separated (no parens) form of [`uniq`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#uniq-pipe), [`top`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#top-pipe) and [`unroll`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unroll-pipe) pipes, consistently with their parens form, which already rejects wildcards. Previously a query such as `uniq by foo*` was accepted but could not be parsed back from its string representation. See [#1487](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1487).
* BUGFIX: [cluster version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/): `vlstorage` now returns the error and stops processing an `/internal/select/*` request when the request cannot be parsed, instead of continuing to handle it and writing the response twice.
* BUGFIX: [cluster version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/): bump the internal protocol version for [the delete endpoints](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#how-to-delete-logs), which switched to multipart encoding in [v1.51.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.51.0) but kept the previous version. A version mismatch between `vlselect` and `vlstorage` for delete requests is now reported instead of silently mishandled. All cluster components must be upgraded together to use delete.
* BUGFIX: [cluster version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/): avoid `cannot connect to storage node at ...: EOF` errors after `vlselect` or `vlinsert` was idle for more than 60 seconds. See [#1440](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1440).
* BUGFIX: [vlselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/): respect `-search.maxQueueDuration` for queued requests. Previously, when the number of concurrent requests exceeded `-search.maxConcurrentRequests`, the extra requests could be queued for much longer than `-search.maxQueueDuration` (up to `-search.maxQueryDuration`) before being rejected, so a few slow queries could stall other requests for everyone. See [#1554](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1554).
* BUGFIX: [vlselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/): properly register `-vmalert.proxyURL` as a secret flag. Previously, this flag was registered after logger initialization and printed in plaintext on application startup.
* BUGFIX: [vlselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/): return `502 Bad Gateway` HTTP response code for incoming queries when one of the `vlstorage` nodes runs a VictoriaLogs version with an incompatible internal API instead of `400 Bad Request`. This is consistent with the `502 Bad Gateway` response returned when a `vlstorage` node is unavailable, and it allows building a proper failover scheme in high-availability setups. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#high-availability).
* BUGFIX: [multi-level cluster setup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#multi-level-cluster-setup): properly return `502 Bad Gateway` HTTP response code when a `vlselect` node queries other `vlselect` nodes and the underlying `vlstorage` is unavailable, as described at [high availability](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#high-availability) docs. This allows configuring proper failover schemes to a healthy cluster.
* BUGFIX: [`/select/tenant_ids`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-tenants): return tenant ids in a deterministic (sorted) order. Previously the order was random across requests. See [#1575](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1575).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix hits chart tooltip layout to prevent long values from overflowing the viewport. See [#1536](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1536).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix filters sidebar opening on mobile. See [#1537](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1537).

## [v1.51.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.51.0)

Released at 2026-06-17

**Update Note 1:** [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): disallow using [`filter` pipes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filter-pipe) without the `filter` prefix if the filter doesn't start with `field_name:` prefix. For example, `foo | bar` is disallowed now. It must be rewritten to one of the following equivalents: `foo bar`, `foo | "bar"`, `foo | _msg:bar` or `foo | filter bar`. This reduces the chances of incorrectly written queries like in the [#1454](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1454). However, this may be a breaking change if you have queries that filter without the `filter` prefix, such as `... | !foo`, `... | {host="x"}`, `... | >5` or `... | =foo` - these now fail with `unexpected pipe` and must add the `filter` prefix (e.g. `... | filter !foo`).

**Update Note 2:** [cluster version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/): this release bumps the internal `vlselect` and `vlstorage` protocol version (see the queries-longer-than-10MB fix in [#1462](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1462)). A version mismatch between `vlselect` and `vlstorage` fails the request, so queries are expected to fail during a rolling upgrade while the cluster runs mixed versions. All the cluster components must be upgraded to this release or newer.

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.26.2 to Go1.26.4. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.26.3](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.26.3%20label%3ACherryPickApproved) and [the list of issues addressed in Go1.26.4](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.26.4%20label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vmalert/): add `-vmalert.proxyURL` command-line flag, which allows proxying `/select/vmalert/*` requests from VictoriaLogs to `vmalert`. See [#90](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/90) and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#vmalert).
* FEATURE: [metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/metrics/): expose filesystem type for storage paths via the `vm_fs_info` metric. This helps identify filesystem-specific issues during troubleshooting. See [#1435](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1435).
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): allow putting `;` in the end of the query. This is useful for detecting the end of multi-line query.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add [`coalesce` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#coalesce-pipe), which returns the first non-empty value from the given list of fields. This is useful when the same value may be stored under different field names across logs, such as `user_id`, `username` or `email`. The pipe can also return a default value when all the fields are empty. See [#690](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/690). Thanks to @warkadiusz for [the pull request #904](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/904).
* FEATURE: [querying API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/): allow using [`limit`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#limit-pipe) and [`offset`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#offset-pipe) pipes after the [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe) in queries to [`/select/logsql/stats_query`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats). This enables the usage for these pipes in [alerting and recording rules for VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vmalert/). See [#1296](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1296).
* FEATURE: [alerts](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/blob/master/deployment/docker/rules): add new alerting rules `PersistentQueueRunsOutOfSpaceIn12Hours` and `PersistentQueueRunsOutOfSpaceIn4Hours` for `vlagent` persistent queue capacity. These alerts help users to take proactive actions before `vlagent` starts dropping logs due to insufficient persistent queue space. See [#10193](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/10193)
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): remove the `Date format` setting and always display timestamps with nanosecond precision. See [#1161](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1161).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add search for filtering fields by name and value in expanded log entries in the Group tab. See [#1378](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1378)
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): rename the "Filters" button to "Show/Hide filters" and update its icon. See [#1247](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1247).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): rename field `Query time` to `Hits query` on the Hits chart panel. The change makes it clear duration of which query is displayed.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add log level detection for displayed log entries. This feature can be toggled in the Group View settings. See [#1245](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1245).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): support nanosecond precision for timestamps. This allows selecting time ranges and displaying log timestamps without rounding them to milliseconds. See [#745](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/745).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): improve `Log context` window user experience:
  * change sorting from older (top) to newer (bottom) log entries to make the experience similar to browsing logs in the shell;
  * replace manual load newer/older controls with an infinite scroll. The scroll will automatically search for logs before or after gradually extending the search window for up to 7d. See [#1397](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1397).
  * display warning if there are logs with identical timestamps, as their sorting order can't be guaranteed. Such logs will be additionally highlighted in the list.
* FEATURE: [dashboards/kubernetes-explorer](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/blob/master/dashboards/victorialogs-kubernetes-explorer.json): add new dashboard for exploring Kubernetes logs via [VictoriaLogs datasource](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/integrations/grafana/) in Grafana. Thanks to @sias32 for [the contribution](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1254)!
* FEATURE: [File Collector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-logs-from-files): enhance glob pattern support with additional syntax: double-star `/**/` for matching nested directories (e.g. `/var/log/**/*.log`), alternatives `{a,b}` for matching multiple specific names (e.g. `{access,error}.log`), character classes `[a-z]` and `?` wildcard for single-character matching. See [#1393](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1393) and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#glob-pattern-requirements) for the full pattern syntax reference.

* BUGFIX: [VictoriaLogs cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/): return a clear error message when `vlselect` requests cannot be parsed by `vlstorage`. Previously the unclear error was generated when `vlselect` sends too long query to `vlstorage`: `unexpected protocol version=""; want "v4"`. See [#1462](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1462).
* BUGFIX: [VictoriaLogs cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/): properly send and parse queries longer than 10MB, which are sent from `vlselect` to `vlstorage`. Such a long queries may be generated if they contain a [subquery filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#subquery-filter), which expands to a long list of items. See [#1462](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1462).
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): fix [`unroll` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unroll-pipe) and [`json_array_len` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#json_array_len-pipe) ignoring JSON arrays preceded by whitespace. See [#1427](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1427).
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): properly calculate [`rate()`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#rate-stats) and [`rate_sum()`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#rate_sum-stats) stats functions in cluster mode for queries grouped by `_time` buckets, such as `... | stats by (_time:5m, status) rate()`. Previously these functions could divide results by the whole query time range instead of the `_time` bucket duration, which could make Grafana range query values unexpectedly low. See [#1451](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1451).
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): allow `unpack_json` to parse JSON objects starting with spaces. See [#1416](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1416).
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): properly quote field filter values whose leading token is a reserved keyword such as `in`, so the query can be parsed back from its string representation. See [#1434](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1434).
* BUGFIX: [vlagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/): hide sensitive values passed via `-remoteWrite.proxyURL` in `/metrics`, `/flags`, and startup logs. Previously these values could be exposed in plain text. See [#1320](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1320).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): improve context view highlight visibility in dark theme. The selected log entry is now highlighted with a more visible blue tint instead of barely visible gray background. See [#1196](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1196).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix live tab ignoring selected stream filters. See [#1342](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1342).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix stream context view where the selected log overlapped transparently with content below when scrolling. See [#1185](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1185).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix browser navigation issues where the UI state didn't update on URL changes. See [#1056](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1056).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): remove extra empty value in `Stream fields` sidebar when selecting all values within a field. See [#1235](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1235).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix target log rendering in the `Log context` modal. See [#1199](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1199).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix border colors so they follow the theme selected in vmui instead of the browser theme. Previously, borders turned black in the light theme when the browser theme was dark. See [#1473](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1473).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): round query execution time in the query label to whole milliseconds instead of displaying excessive floating-point precision. See [#1496](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1496).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): preserve the selected tenant while switching between vmui tabs. See [#1447](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1447).
* BUGFIX: [HTTP querying APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): return `502 Bad Gateway` from [`/select/logsql/stats_query`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats) and [`/select/logsql/stats_query_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-range-stats) when one of `vlstorage` nodes is unavailable in cluster mode. Previously these endpoints could incorrectly return `422 Unprocessable Entity`, which could break retry and failover handling in high-availability setups. See [#1419](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1419).

## [v1.50.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.50.0)

Released at 2026-04-14

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.26.1 to Go1.26.2. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.26.2](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.26.2%20label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): add an ability to send logs via Splunk data ingestion protocol. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/splunk/). See [#710](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/710).
* FEATURE: [vlagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/): add an ability to collect logs from arbitrary files by specifying the glob pattern. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-logs-from-files) and [#1195](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1195).
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): improve validation for [`stats switch(...)`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-with-additional-filters) by rejecting empty `switch()` expressions and multiple `default` branches. This helps catch invalid queries earlier and avoids confusing results. See [#1300](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1300).
* FEATURE: [LogsLQ](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add an ability to search across multiple log fields with the `field_name_prefix*:filter` syntax. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#searching-over-multiple-fields) for details. See [#82](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/82).
* FEATURE: [Loki data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/promtail/): Add an ability to add the given prefix to log field names parsed from JSON message. This may be used for avoiding clash between log stream labels and the automatically parsed log field names. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/promtail/#parsing-log-message) for details. See [#1127](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1127).
* FEATURE: [Datadog](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/datadog-agent/): support default Datadog ingestion paths such as `/api/v2/logs` and `/api/v1/validate` in addition to the existing `/insert/datadog/...` paths. This eliminates the need to put [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) in front of VictoriaLogs for adding `/insert/datadog/` prefix to the paths requested by DataDog agent.

* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): properly return the field value for the log with the maximum `_time` field from [`field_max(_time, field)`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#field_max-stats). Previously incorrect value could be returned. See [#1294](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1294).
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): properly return the log entry with the maximum `_time` field from [`row_max(_time)`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#row_max-stats). Previously incorrect log could be returned.
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): consistently match logs on the interval `[t-d ... t)` when using [`_time:d`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter) filter at the timestamp `t`. This aligns with the semantics of `start` and `end` query args at [querying API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/), which select logs on the `[start ... end)` time range. This also makes more consistent and expected the results returned from [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vmalert/). See [#1226](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1226) and [#9753 at VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9753).
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): return a parse error for invalid weekday names in the [`week_range` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#week-range-filter). Previously they were silently treated as `Sunday`, which could lead to incorrect query results. See [#1269](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1269).
* BUGFIX: [Datadog data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/datadog-agent/): properly ingest logs with tags without values, such as `env:prod,foo`, by storing `foo` with the `no_label_value` value. Previously this could crash VictoriaLogs during log ingestion. See [#1303](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1303).
* BUGFIX: [Kubernetes Collector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-kubernetes-pod-logs): honor [`-defaultMsgValue`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#common-flags) for logs without message fields. Previously `vlagent` stored the hard-coded `missing _msg field; ...` text instead of the configured value when logs were collected via `kubernetesCollector`. See [#1283](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1283).
* BUGFIX: [/select/logsql/hits](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-hits-stats): fix `invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference` panic when the `query` passed to `/select/logsql/hits` contains [`union rows(...)`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#adding-static-logs). The panic has been introduced in [v1.49.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.49.0).
* BUGFIX: [/select/logsql/hits](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-hits-stats): fix panic when the internal `stats` pipe generated for this endpoint uses `hits` both as a grouping field and as the result name. See [#1278](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1278).
* BUGFIX: [OpenTelemetry data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/opentelemetry/): replace custom `severity` field with `severity_number` and `severity_text` to be compatible with other solutions. See [#1246](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1246).
* BUGFIX: [vlagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/): hide sensitive values passed via `-remoteWrite.headers` in `/metrics`, `/flags`, and startup logs. Previously these values could be exposed in plain text.
* BUGFIX: [storage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#partitions-lifecycle): fix `cannot read directory contents: open ... .DS_Store: not a directory` panic when restarting VictoriaLogs on MacOS. See [#996](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/996).
* BUGFIX: [partitions lifecycle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#partitions-lifecycle): fix querying logs after detaching, removing and then re-creating the same per-day partition before VictoriaLogs restart. Previously newly ingested logs could be missing from normal queries and from `_stream:{...}` filters until restart. See [#657](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/657).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix incorrect border colors. The issue was introduced in [v1.49.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.49.0). See [#1271](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1271).

* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add include/exclude filter actions for log fields in log details. See [#369](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/369).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add a query examples modal with categories. See [#1085](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1085).
* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): accept logs with the correctly formatted [`_stream` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields). This allows importing raw logs received from [`/select/logsql/query` endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs), without the need in additional transformations. See [#1122](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1122).
* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): verify the [`_stream` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) correctness when ingesting data via [native and internal protocols](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#multitenancy) (`native` protocol is used by [`vlagent`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/) for sending the data to VictoriaLogs, while `internal` protocol is used by `vlinsert` for sending the data to `vlstorage` in [VictoriaLogs cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/) ). See [#38](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/38).
* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): introduce `/insert/multitenant/native` endpoint for accepting logs with mixed tenants from `vlagent` according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#multitenancy). Previously `vlagent` was using `/internal/insert` endpoint for sending logs with mixed tenants. It is recommended using `/insert/multitenant/native` endpoint instead, since `/internal/insert` endpoint is intended for internal communcations between `vlinsert` and `vlstorage` in [cluster mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/). See [#1189](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1189).
* FEATURE: [`/select/logsql/query` HTTP endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs): allow returning results in CSV format for arbitrary query without any restrictions according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs-in-csv-format). See See [#1143](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1143).
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): support `switch(case ..., default ...)` syntax syntax inside [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe) for calculating the stats for logs matching the given set of filters. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-with-additional-filters) for more details. See [#1184](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1184).
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add an ability to set global filters, which must be applied to all the subqueries in the current query, via [`global_filter` option](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#global_filter-query-option). See [#1183](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1183).
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add an ability to enrich the selected logs with pre-defined static fields. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#enriching-logs-with-static-fields) for details.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add an ability to append pre-defined static rows to the selected logs. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#adding-static-logs) for details.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add [`stddev` stats function](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stddev-stats) for calculating [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) over the given log fields. See [#41](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/41).
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add an ability to filter the field names returned from the [`field_names` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#field_names-pipe) by using `field_names filter "substring"` syntax - it returns field names containing the given `substring`.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add an ability to filter the field values returned from the [`field_values` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#field_values-pipe) by using `field_values some_field filter "substring"` syntax - it returns values containing the given `substring` for the given `some_field`.
* FEATURE: [`/select/logsql/field_names` HTTP endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-field-names): add support for an optional `filter=substring` query arg, which allows returning only the field names containing the given `substring`. See [#1186](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1186).
* FEATURE: [`/select/logsql/field_values` HTTP endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-field-values): add support for an optional `filter=substring` query arg, which allows returning only the field values containing the given `substring`. See [#1186](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1186).

* FEATURE: [`/select/logsql/stream_field_values` HTTP endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-stream-field-values): add support for an optional `filter=substring` query arg, which allows returning only the field values containing the given `substring`. See [#1186](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1186).

* BUGFIX: [/select/logsql/query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs): fix panic when exporting query results in CSV format if a field contains multiple quoted segments. See [#1220](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1220).
* BUGFIX: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): properly handle the case when the ingested logs contain `_time` field without the real timestamp, and this field is not mentioned in the `_time_field` query arg or in the `VL-Time-Field` request header according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#http-parameters). Previously this could lead to unexpected errors during querying such as `missing _time field in the query results`. See [#1168](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1168).
* BUGFIX: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): eliminate the data race, which could lead to improper update for the `vl_rows_merged_total{type="storage/inmemory"}` and `vl_merge_bytes{type="storage/inmemory"}` metrics. See [#836](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/836).
* BUGFIX: [delete API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#how-to-delete-logs): properly evaluate relative `_time` filters for delayed delete tasks according to the task start time instead of the later execution time. Previously this could lead to deleting an unexpected time range or to deleting nothing. See [#1213](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1213).
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): properly apply [query options](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#query-options) at `vlselect` in [cluster setup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/). Previously the options were sent to `vlstorage`, but were ignored at `vlselect`. This could lead to incorrect query results.
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): fix `count_uniq()` and `count_uniq_hash()` in [cluster setup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/) for `vlstorage` nodes with 128 or more CPU cores. Previously such queries could fail during state merge at `vlselect` with errors such as `cannot import state for count_uniq(...)`. See [#1225](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1225).
* BUGFIX: [Kubernetes Collector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-kubernetes-pod-logs): add support for interleaved stdout/stderr partial CRI log lines merging. Previously, if a CRI log file contained interleaved stdout and stderr lines, `vlagent` treated them as a same log stream, which could lead to incorrect partial log merging. See [#1215](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1215). Thanks to @charlie0129 for [the pull request #1218](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1218).
* BUGFIX: [Kubernetes Collector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-kubernetes-pod-logs): skip invalid CRI log entries instead of failing with `FATAL: cannot process line from file`. This error can occur after an unclean Node shutdown when a log entry is partially written. See [#1217](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1217) and [#1076](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1076).

Thanks to @NaturalSpottingSmite for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1233).
* BUGFIX: [live tailing API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#live-tailing): validate `refresh_interval` for `/select/logsql/tail` and return `400 Bad Request` on invalid values. Previously, `refresh_interval=0s` or a negative duration could trigger a panic and crash the process. See [#1234](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1243). Thanks to @cuongleqq for the fix.
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix UI freeze when selecting a long time range.
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): truncate long active filter badges and show full values in tooltip. See [#369](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/369#issuecomment-4080410326)
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): show active filters in Stream Fields empty state instead of "No stream fields found".
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): properly apply `offset` when returning the last N logs sorted by `_time desc`, so queries like `| sort by (_time) desc | offset X | limit Y` return empty results when `X` is greater than or equal to the number of matched logs. Previously, such queries could incorrectly return all matched logs. See [#1190](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1190).
* BUGFIX: All VictoriaLogs components: Fix `unsupported` metric type display in exposed metric metadata for summaries and quantiles. This `unsupported` type exists when a summary is not updated within a certain time window. See [#120](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/metrics/issues/120) for details.

* FEATURE: [Kubernetes Collector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-kubernetes-pod-logs): add an ability to include Namespace labels and annotations in log entries. This metadata is also available for filtering via [`-kubernetesCollector.excludeFilter`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#filtering-kubernetes-logs) command-line flag. See [#1158](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1158) and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#kubernetes-metadata-configuration) for details.
* FEATURE: publish [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) SBOM attestations for container images on `docker.io` and `quay.io`. See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/blob/master/SECURITY.md), [#1102](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1102).
* FEATURE: [`/select/logsql/query` endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs): support returning query results in CSV format when `format=csv` query arg is passed to this endpoint according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs-in-csv-format). This functionality is going to be used for downloading query results as CSV files in the [built-in web UI for VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui). See [#1143](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1143).
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add support for `offset` modifier to [`first`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#first-total_stats) and [`last`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#last-total_stats) functions at the [`total_stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#total_stats-pipe).
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add [`last`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#last-running_stats) function at the [`running_stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#running_stats-pipe). This can be used for comparing sequential log field values. See [#932](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/932).
* FEATURE: [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/): allow limiting the length of the query, which can be passed to querying endpoints, with `-search.maxQueryLen` command-line flag. This flag can be used for preventing from excess resource usage, which could be needed for parsing and processing too long queries. See [#1159](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1159).
* FEATURE: [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/): support the ability to ignore pipes in the `query` passed to [HTTP querying endpoints](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api) if `ignore_pipes=1` query arg is passed there. This is needed for implementing the filtering by log stream fields in [#1084](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1084). See [#1156](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1156).
* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): skip logs with `_stream` or `_stream_id` fields, since these fields clash with the automatically generated fields by VictoriaLogs according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields). VictoriaLogs generates a warning per each such skipped log, so it could be noticed and fixed by users. See [#1122](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1122).

* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): fix panic when executing the query `_stream_id:in`. See [#1136](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1136).
* BUGFIX: fix VictoriaLogs Docker OCI labels `org.opencontainers.image.source` and `org.opencontainers.image.documentation`: point them to VictoriaLogs repo/docs instead of VictoriaMetrics.
* BUGFIX: [Kubernetes Collector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-kubernetes-pod-logs): fix spurious `cannot parse WatchEvent json response: EOF` errors in logs. These errors were harmless but could cause confusion when monitoring application health.
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): preserve existing target field values for `extract if (...)` and `extract_regexp if (...)` when the `if (...)` condition doesn't match. See [#1153](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1153).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix incorrect bar width in the Hits graph in Stats view mode. See [#1149](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1149).
* BUGFIX: [vlagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/): include missing `_time` field for outgoing logs when using [jsonline format](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#remote-write-format). Previously, `vlagent` omitted the `_time` field when sending logs to remote storage in this format.

## [v1.46.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.46.0)

Released at 2026-02-23

**Update Note 1:** `vlselect` in [VictoriaLogs cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/): queries such as [`/select/logsql/hits`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-hits-stats) may fail or panic after upgrading to `v1.46.0` if one `vlselect` node queries another `vlselect` node running a different VictoriaLogs version. To avoid the issue, keep all the `vlselect` nodes on the same VictoriaLogs version during upgrade.

* FEATURE: upgrade Go builder from Go1.25.7 to Go1.26.0. See [Go 1.26 release notes](https://go.dev/doc/go1.26).
* FEATURE: [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/): sort response fields by their name unless the query ends with a pipe, which preserves the order of the returned fields such as [`fields`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#fields-pipe) and [`stats`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe). Previously the order of the returned fields was undefined. See [#1011](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1011).
* FEATURE: [vlagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/): add an ability to send logs to remote storage in [`jsonline` format](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#json-stream-api). This is useful for sending logs to other systems (for example, Vector, Fluent Bit, ClickHouse). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#remote-write-format) for more details.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add support for resizing and reordering columns in Table View. See [#76](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/76) and [#714](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/714).

* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): change group-by toggle behavior to clear grouping instead of resetting it to `_stream`. See [#1059](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1059).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add stream fields chips to the Log context modal. See [#1065](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1065).

* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): prevent from `cannot parse already verified regexp` panic when special regexp is passed to [regexp filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#regexp-filter). See [#1112](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1112).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix markdown parsing for log lines starting with tabs in group view.
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix timestamp rendering according to the selected timezone. See [#63](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/63).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix copy action to copy only selected columns instead of the full log entry.
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix auto-suggest popup description panel changing when moving the mouse from a hovered item to the description. The description panel is now displayed to the right of the options list, so navigating to it no longer triggers hover events on other list items. See [#1117](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1117).

## [v1.45.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.45.0)

Users can use it to navigate directly to the source code location that generated those logs, making debugging and code exploration easier. See [#1074](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1074).
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add [`ipv6_range` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#ipv6-range-filter) for filtering logs by IPv6 address fields and CIDR ranges. This is an IPv6 counterpart to the existing [`ipv4_range` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#ipv4-range-filter) and allows efficient matching over stored IPv6 addresses. See [#84](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/84). Thanks to @caicancai for the [implementation](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1049).
* FEATURE: [`/select/logsql/stats_query_range` endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-range-stats): support optional `offset` query arg, which can contain timezone offset for the returned timestamps.

See [#933](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/933).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add the `offset` parameter so bar chart data is aligned with the user-selected timezone. See [#1039](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1039).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add support for toggling line comments with `Ctrl/Cmd + /`. See [#1030](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1030).

* BUGFIX: [`/select/logsql/hits` endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-hits-stats): properly apply `offset` arg. Previously it resulted in incorrect calculations for the returned timestamps.
* BUGFIX: [Loki data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/promtail/): properly parse JSON-encoded log fields inside Loki log message if it ends with whitespace chars such as `\n`. See [#1044](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1044).
* BUGFIX: [dashboard/single-node](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/22084): include `internalinsert` (`/internal/insert`) in `Logs ingestion rate` panels, so they work for data ingested via `vlagent` configured with `-remoteWrite.url=.../internal/insert`. See [#1053](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1053).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix autocomplete insertion to prevent overwriting remaining input and preserve newline characters. See [#917](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/917).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix unexpected query expression reset to the previous value when clicking on "Hide chart" button. See [#1063](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1063).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix cumulative bar chart by carrying over previous value for nullish bars. This ensures that the cumulative bar chart doesn't decrease over time.
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix missing first bar when it starts before the selected range but ends within it.
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix redundant `/select/logsql/query_time_range` requests.
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix responsive layout and styles.

## [v1.44.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.44.0)

Released at 2026-01-27

* SECURITY: upgrade base docker image (Alpine) from 3.22.2 to 3.23.2. See [Alpine 3.23.2 release notes](https://www.alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.23.2-released.html).
* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.25.5 to Go1.25.6. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.25.6](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.25.6%20label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* FEATURE: add an ability to delete snapshots via `/internal/partition/snapshot/delete` endpoint. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#how-to-remove-snapshots) and [#828](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/828).
* FEATURE: add an ability to delete stale snapshots via `/internal/partition/snapshot/delete_stale?max_age=<d>` endpoint. Snapshots older than `<d>` are automatically deleted. For example, `max_age=1d` removes snapshots older than one day. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#how-to-remove-snapshots).
* FEATURE: add an ability to automatically delete stale snapshots older than the value passed to `-snapshotsMaxAge` command-line flag. See [#829](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/829) and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#how-to-remove-snapshots). Thanks to @withlin for [the initial implementation](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/975).
* FEATURE: add an ability to create snapshots for multiple per-day partitions matching the given `partition_prefix` passed to [`/internal/partition/snapshot/create`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#partitions-lifecycle). For example, `/internal/partition/snapshot/create?partition_prefix=202601` creates snapshots for all the active per-day partitions for January 2026.
* FEATURE: [Journald data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/journald/): add `-journald.useRemoteIP` flag for saving the remote IP address in the `remote_ip` field. Thanks to @NaturalSpottingSmite for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/964).
* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): add an ability to avoid [flattening](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) of JSON values for the given keys enumerated via `preserve_json_keys` query arg or via `VL-Preserve-JSON-Keys` http request header. This may be useful if the input JSON-encoded logs contain high-cardinality key names such as `sku-*` in the `{"items":{"sku-1":{...},...,"sku-N":{...}}}`. Then `preserve_json_keys=items` would preserve the `items` field value as is, e.g. it will be equal to the string `{"sku-1":{...},...,"sku-N":{...}}`. See more details about these options at [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#http-parameters) and at [#1002](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/1002).
* FEATURE: [dashboards/internal](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/24585): add Grafana dashboard for monitoring VictoriaLogs internal state. The source of the dashboard is available [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/blob/master/dashboards/victorialogs-internal.json).
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add `pattern_match_prefix()` and `pattern_match_suffix()` filters for matching the given pattern at the beginning or at the end of the log field value. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pattern-match-filter) and [#762](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/762).
* FEATURE: [Kubernetes Collector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-kubernetes-pod-logs): add an ability to change default [`_stream`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) fields via `-kubernetesCollector.streamFields` command-line flag. See [#998](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/998).
* FEATURE: [querying HTTP API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): accept `step` arg with nanosecond precision at [`/select/logsql/hits`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-hits-stats) and [`/select/logsql/stats_query_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-range-stats) endpoints. Previously these endpoints were accepting the `step` query arg only with millisecond precision.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add pipe titles with links to [docs.victoriametrics.com](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) in autocomplete popup.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add a cumulative view option to hits bar chart. See [#955](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/955).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add configurable bar count for hits chart. See [#956](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/956).

* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): properly apply time offset according to the docs for the [`day_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#day-range-filter) and [`week_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#week-range-filter) filters. Previously `offset 2h` was incorrectly translated into `-02:00` timezone offset instead of the expected `+02:00` timezone offset. See [#796](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/796).
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): use local time zone for the VictoriaLogs server when the [`day_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#day-range-filter) or [`week_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#week-range-filter) filter doesn't contain explicitly specified `offset ...` suffix. This aligns with the behaviour when the timezone information is missing in the [`_time` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter).
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): fix panic when executing `"_stream":=""`, `"_stream_id":=""` or `"_time":foo` queries. See [#717](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/717). Thanks to @withlin for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/979).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix bars width calculation and visual misalignment relative to time axis. See [#900](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/900).
* BUGFIX: [metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/metrics/): fix `vl_http_errors_total{path="..."}` metric name mismatch for `/internal/select/*` endpoints (it was exposed as `vl_http_request_errors_total{path="..."}`). See [#1005](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/1005).
* BUGFIX: [Kubernetes Collector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-kubernetes-pod-logs): add support for dynamic token and certificates reloading. Previously, vlagent only read credentials at startup, which led to authentication errors after token rotation. See [#995](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/995).
* BUGFIX: [Kubernetes Collector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-kubernetes-pod-logs): properly parse [Kubernetes system log](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-logs/) timestamps. This prevents future logs issues that occurred during the New Year transition.
* BUGFIX: [Kubernetes Collector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-kubernetes-pod-logs): add additional file fingerprint validation when resuming from a stale checkpoint file. This prevents `cannot parse Container Runtime Interface log line` errors that could occur if multiple log rotations happened while vlagent was down.
* BUGFIX: [HTTP data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): properly handle empty items in comma-separated HTTP ingestion params such as `VL-Stream-Fields`, `VL-Time-Field`, `VL-Msg-Field`, `VL-Ignore-Fields` and `VL-Decolorize-Fields`. Previously, empty items in `VL-Stream-Fields` (e.g. `foo,,bar`) could unexpectedly add `_msg` to stream fields and lead to unexpectedly high number of log streams. See [#966](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/966).

## [v1.43.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.43.1)

Released at 2025-12-26

* BUGFIX: [`/select/logsql/facets` endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-facets): fix `expecting 3 columns; got 4 columns` panic when `/select/logsql/facets` endpoint is queried at [cluster version of VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/). See [#940](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/940). The issue has been introduced in [this commit](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/commit/7f66493f5939de08b8af608b5ab2ed04b9c64c72) in the [release v1.35.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.35.0).
* BUGFIX: [Kubernetes Collector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-kubernetes-pod-logs): properly handle "410 Gone" responses from the Kubernetes API server. Previously, vlagent could report 410 errors and fail to collect logs from newly discovered Pods. The bug has been introduced in [v1.43.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.43.0).
* BUGFIX: [HTTP querying API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): properly add labels from the `by (...)` clause to responses returned from [`/select/logsql/stats_query`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats) and [`/select/logsql/stats_query_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-range-stats) endpoints for [`histogram()` stats function](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#histogram-stats) results. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/10184#issuecomment-3693193925) for details.

## [v1.43.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.43.0)

Released at 2025-12-22

* FEATURE: [Kubernetes Collector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-kubernetes-pod-logs): add an ability to include and exclude Pod/Node labels and annotation fields from logs. This metadata is also available for [filtering](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#filtering-kubernetes-logs). See [#923](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/923) and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#kubernetes-metadata-configuration) for details.
* FEATURE: [Kubernetes Collector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-kubernetes-pod-logs): reduce a load on the Kubernetes API by using [resource versions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions) to ignore already processed events when a TCP connection is dropped. In the previous version, vlagent would request the full state of the current node from the control plane every 5 minutes, which could lead to an increased load on the central API server in large clusters.

* BUGFIX: [vlstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/): fix incorrect warning logs about time field in `/internal/insert` and `/internal/native` APIs. Thanks to @cyberzz-dev for the [issue #937](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/937).

## [v1.42.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.42.0)

Released at 2025-12-20

* FEATURE: [HTTP querying API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): convert [`histogram` stats](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#histogram-stats) results to [VictoriaMetrics histogram buckets](https://valyala.medium.com/improving-histogram-usability-for-prometheus-and-grafana-bc7e5df0e350) in responses from [`/select/logsql/stats_query`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats) and [`/select/logsql/stats_query_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-range-stats) endpoints. This allows using `histogram()` stats in [recording rules for VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vmalert/#recording-rules). See [#10184 at VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/10184), [#86](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/86) and [#62 at VictoriaLogs plugin for Grafana](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/victorialogs-datasource/issues/62).
* FEATURE: [Kubernetes Collector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-kubernetes-pod-logs): add support for metadata-based filtering for Kubernetes logs via `-kubernetesCollector.excludeFilter` command-line flag. The flag accepts any [LogsQL filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filters) which is applied to Pod labels, namespaces, and other metadata before reading the log files. This enables early exclusion of unwanted log records, reducing CPU usage and I/O overhead. See [#923](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/923) and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#filtering-kubernetes-logs) for details.
* FEATURE: [Kubernetes Collector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-kubernetes-pod-logs): automatically parse [Kubernetes system logs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-logs/) as structured data.

* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): return [`_stream` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) from [`block_stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#block_stats-pipe). This allows detecting log streams, which occupy the most of disk space [according to this query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/faq/#how-to-determine-which-log-streams-occupy-the-most-of-disk-space).
* FEATURE: [OpenTelemetry data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/opentelemetry/): parse [`scope` inside ScopeLogs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/a5f0eac5b802f7ae51dfe41e5116fe5548955e64/opentelemetry/proto/logs/v1/logs.proto#L72) and store it into [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) starting with `scope.` prefix.

* FEATURE: [vlagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/): add an ability to collect logs from Kubernetes Pods. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/#collect-kubernetes-pod-logs) for details. Thanks to @vadimalekseev for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/815). See [#538](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/538).
* FEATURE: [OpenTelemetry data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/opentelemetry/): reduce CPU usage by up to 10x. Thanks to @vadimalekseev for [the pull request #720](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/720).
* FEATURE: [OpenTelemetry data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/opentelemetry/): parse `EventName` in the `LogRecord` and store it into [log stream fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields). See [#826](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/826).
* FEATURE: [HTTP querying API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): automatically convert the results of [`row_any()`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#row_any-stats), [`row_min()`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#row_min-stats) and [`row_max()`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#row_max-stats) stats functions to labels in [`/select/logsql/stats_query`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats) and [`/select/logsql/stats_query_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-range-stats) functions. This allows obtaining a sample of log messages in alerting rules with the following query: `... | stats count() as hits, row_any(_msg) as msg_sample`. See [#81](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/81).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): show VictoriaLogs version in the vmui's footer. See [#116](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/116).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): sync selected tenant with AccountID/ProjectID returned in response headers. See [#656](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/656).

## [v1.39.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.39.0)

Released at 2025-11-29

* FEATURE: [syslog data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/): add support for automatic parsing of [`@cee` messages](http://cee.mitre.org/language/1.0-beta1/clt.html#syslog). Thanks to @exherb for the pull request [#842](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/842).
* FEATURE: [HTTP querying APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): return `AccountID` and `ProjectID` response headers, which match the corresponding request headers when executing [queries for the particular tenant](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#multitenancy). These response headers can be used by client such as [built-in web UI for VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui) for the proper displaying of the queried tenant. See [#656](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/656).
* FEATURE: [Elasticsearch data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#elasticsearch-bulk-api): return the first parse error to the client, so the error could be quickly fixed. Previously, the parse error was logged into VictoriaLogs internal logs and `success` response was returned to the client. This could complicate troubleshooting, since users need to have access to VictoriaLogs internal logs for the troubleshooting. See [#817](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/817) and [#60](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/60).
* FEATURE: [hits API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-hits-stats): consistently return zero hits on the selected `[start .. end)` time range. Previously, zero hits weren't returned, so this complicated the processing of the hits response by clients. See [#700](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/700).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add the help button with shortcuts reference and controls for charts and query input. See [#77](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/77).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): auto-sync time picker with `_time` filter from the query (can be disabled). See [#558](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/558).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): automatically load and display available tenants using `/select/tenant_ids`. See [#821](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/821).

* BUGFIX: [delete API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#how-to-delete-logs): prevent from possible fatal error (panic) at `block_stream_merger.go:237` during the deletion of the logs. See [#825](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/825).
* BUGFIX: [`/select/logsql/query` endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs): properly return the last N logs with the biggest timestamps when the `limit=N` query arg is passed to this endpoint. Also, properly return logs from [LogsQL queries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) ending with `| sort by (_time desc) limit N` pipe. Previously, some logs may be missing because of an off-by-one error. See [#802](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/802).

## [v1.38.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.38.0)

Released at 2025-11-14

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.25.3 to Go1.25.4. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.25.4](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.25.4%20label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* FEATURE: add an ability to delete stored logs. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#how-to-delete-logs) and [#43](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/43). Thanks to @func25 for the initial idea and implementation at [#4](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/4).
* FEATURE: add an ability to hide the given [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) on a per-query basis. This may be useful for restricting access to log fields with sensitive information, by specifying the list of the fields to hide via `hidden_fields_filters` query arg. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#hidden-fields) for details. See [#668](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/668).
* FEATURE: [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/): add slow query logging via `-search.logSlowQueryDuration`; increments `vl_slow_queries_total`. See [#750](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/750).
* FEATURE: [querying API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): add support for `/select/tenant_ids` endpoint, which returns [tenant IDs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#multitenancy) for the existing logs on the given `[start .. end)` time range. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-tenants) and [#158 at victorialogs-datasource](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/victorialogs-datasource/issues/158).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): simplify "Download logs" dialog - show only file name field and description with time range and tenant. See [#789](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/789).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): update text for skipping warning modal and increase large load limit to `1000`. See [#808](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/808).

* BUGFIX: [Loki data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/promtail/): fix handling of `Content-Type` HTTP header in `/insert/loki/api/v1/push` endpoint to allow support Clients that send charset or additional information in header. See [#813](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/813).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix `/hits` graph showing the first point outside the selected time range. See [#737](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/737).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix `hits` chart not updating when changing the `group by` field. See [#788](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/788).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): replace GET with POST for `field_names` and `stream_field_names` requests. See [#818](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/818).

## [v1.37.2](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.37.2)

Released at 2025-11-01

* BUGFIX: fix panic `BUG: bsm.bd must be empty`, which can occur during data ingestion and background merging of already ingested logs. See [#792](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/792). The panic has been introduced in [v1.37.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.37.1).

## [v1.37.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.37.1)

Released at 2025-11-01

* BUGFIX: fix the increased CPU usage during data ingestion. The issue has been introduced in [v1.37.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.37.0).
* BUGFIX: [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#live-tailing): fix `/select/logsql/tail` requests being rejected by `-search.maxQueryTimeRange` when the query relied on the tail window for the time filter. Live tailing now continues to work with that flag enabled. See [#760](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/760).
* BUGFIX: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#elasticsearch-bulk-api): Elasticsearch `_bulk` parse warnings now show the client address, request URI, and tail of the bad payload, so broken batches are easier to spot. See [#60](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/60).

## [v1.37.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.37.0)

Released at 2025-10-30

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.25.2 to Go1.25.3. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.25.3](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.25.3%20label%3ACherryPickApproved).
* SECURITY: upgrade base docker image (Alpine) from 3.22.1 to 3.22.2. See [Alpine 3.22.2 release notes](https://www.alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.19.9-3.20.8-3.21.5-3.22.2-released.html).

* FEATURE: add an ability to limit the age of the accepted logs via `-maxBackfillAge` command-line flag. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#backfilling).
* FEATURE: add an ability to temporarily enable logging of newly ingested [log streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) during the given number of seconds. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#logging-new-streams).
* FEATURE: add `-fs.maxConcurrency` command-line flag for tuning the number of concurrent operations with files. See [#774](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/774).
* FEATURE: add linux/s390x artifact to releases. See [#646](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/646).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add Overview page for quick log characteristic inspection. See [#516](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/516).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): allows grouping hits graph by any field with configurable top-N. See [#110](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/110).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add an option to download all logs without limit in `.jsonl` format. See [#627](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/627).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): allows opening time zone settings from the date/time picker.

* BUGFIX: [pattern_match filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pattern-match-filter): fix non-progress loop in `pattern_match(...)` filter when the pattern starts with a literal separator that occurs multiple times in the target string and the rest of the pattern doesn't match. Previously, this could make queries spin indefinitely. Now the matcher advances correctly and returns no match as expected. See [#759](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/759).
* BUGFIX: [vlogscli](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/): fix basic auth **not being applied** when using `-username` and `-password`. See [#761](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/761)
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix page not resetting after changing the query in the Group View tab. See [#753](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/753).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix log rendering with `markdown` enabled and [`collapse_nums` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#collapse_nums-pipe). See [#647](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/647).

* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add warning modal for `limit > 500` with session suppression; validate limit to `[1, 10000]`. See [#500](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/500).

* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix incorrect X-axis time labels after switching time zones; axis ticks now reflect the selected time zone correctly.

## [v1.36.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.36.0)

Released at 2025-10-08

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.25.1 to Go1.25.2. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.25.2](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.25.2%20label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): improve [`collapse_nums` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#collapse_nums-pipe) by treating `_` (underscore) as a separator for numeric tokens. This enables collapsing underscore‑delimited numbers (e.g. `temp_23_175863242537_93_98_` → `temp_<N>_<N>_<N>_<N>_`) for better normalization and grouping. See [#703](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/703).

* BUGFIX: [HTTP querying APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): treat `end` query arg as exclusive bound for time ranges, i.e. use `[start, end)` instead of `[start, end]`, e.g. the first nanosecond at the `end` isn't included in the selected time range. This affects endpoints accepting `start`/`end` (e.g. `/select/logsql/query`, `/select/logsql/hits`, `/select/logsql/stats_query_range`, `/select/logsql/streams`, etc.). See [VictoriaMetrics#9753](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9753) and [#587](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/587) for more details.
* BUGFIX: all components: restore sorting order of summary and quantile metrics exposed by VictoriaLogs components on `/metrics` page. See [metrics#105](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/metrics/pull/105) for details.

## [v1.35.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.35.0)

Released at 2025-09-27

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.25.0 to Go1.25.1. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.25.1](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.25.1%20label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add [`equals_common_case` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#equals_common_case-filter) and [`contains_common_case` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#contains_common_case-filter). These filters can be used as faster alternatives to [`i(...)` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#case-insensitive-filter). For example, `_msg:contains_common_case("VictoriaMetrics")` matches logs with the [`_msg` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#message-field) containing at least one of the following [words](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#word): `VictoriaMetrics`, `victoriametrics`, `VICTORIAMETRICS`, `Victoriametrics` or `victoriaMetrics`.
* FEATURE: [`/select/logsql/stats_query`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats): allow placing other pipes in front of `| stats ...`, including pipes that modify or drop the `_time` field. This relaxes the previous guard for instant stats and allows using queries like `* | field_names | stats count()` in instant queries at [Grafana plugin for VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/integrations/grafana/) and in recording and alerting rules at [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vmalert/). See [#681](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/681).
* FEATURE: [Syslog data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/): automatically parse [CEF messages](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/arcsight/arcsight-smartconnectors-8.3/cef-implementation-standard/Content/CEF/Chapter%201%20What%20is%20CEF.htm) embedded into Syslog messages. CEF messages (aka Common Event Format messages) are typically generated by [SIEM systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management). This simplifies using VictoriaLogs as a database for SIEM logs. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/#cef) for details.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add [`set_stream_fields` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#set_stream_fields-pipe), which allows constructing the [`_stream` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) from the given log fields. This pipe is going to be used by [vlagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/) for logs' transformation before sending them to the remote storage.
* FEATURE: [metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/metrics/): expose minimum and maximum timestamps across stored logs via `vl_storage_log_min_timestamp_seconds` and `vl_storage_log_max_timestamp_seconds` metrics. See [#695](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/695).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): consistently display timestamps with nanosecond precision across all the views in the built-in web UI. See [#675](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/675).

* BUGFIX: [`facets` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#facets-pipe): properly skip field names with more than `max_values_per_field` unique values. Previously, these fields could be returned with an incomplete number of hits.
* BUGFIX: [`rename` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#rename-pipe): keep fields starting with `dst` when `rename src* dst*` is used. Previously, all the `dst*` fields were incorrectly dropped. See [#691](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/691) for more details.
* BUGFIX: [`copy` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#rename-pipe): keep fields starting with `dst` when `copy src* dst*` is used. Previously, all the `dst*` fields were incorrectly dropped. See [#691](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/691) for more details.
* BUGFIX: [`format` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#format-pipe): properly load the original field values for the `dst_field` when the `if(...)` part doesn't match the current log entry inside the `| format if (...) ... as dst_field`. Previously, the `dst_field` was incorrectly skipped in this case unless the `keep_original_fields` or `skip_empty_results` options were set.
* BUGFIX: [`/select/logsql/stats_query`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats) and [`/select/logsql/stats_query_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-range-stats) endpoints: allow using [`unroll` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unroll-pipe) in LogsQL queries at [Grafana plugin for VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/integrations/grafana/) and at alerting and recording rules at [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vmalert/). See [#697](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/697). The issue was introduced in [this commit](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/commit/0bfbe6b18f8f976c6dd4ca6e1980debc4c537be7), which was then included in [VictoriaLogs v1.29.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.29.0).
* BUGFIX: [`/select/logsql/query` endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs): properly handle queries with the [`rename`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#rename-pipe) and [`copy`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#copy-pipe) pipe, which modifies or removes the `_time` field, when these queries are issued by [Grafana plugin for VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/integrations/grafana/) or by the [built-in web UI for VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui).

* FEATURE: [`extract` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#extract-pipe): the `<...>` placeholder now matches quoted strings in single quotes in addition to strings in double quotes and backticks. For example, the `<login>` placeholder at the `... | extract "login=<login>,"` now matches `foo,bar` for the log message with the text `login='foo,bar'`.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add [pattern match filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pattern-match-filter) for searching logs by the given patterns such as `<DATETIME>: user_id=<N>, ip=<IP4>, trace_id=<UUID>`. These filters are needed for [#518](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/518).
* FEATURE: [Syslog data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/): support for receiving Syslog messages from Unix sockets of `SOCK_STREAM` and `SOCK_DGRAM` types via `-syslog.listenAddr.unix=/path/to/socket` and `-syslog.listenAddr.unix=unixgram:/path/to/socket` command-line flags. See [#570](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/570).

* BUGFIX: [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/): `-search.maxQueryTimeRange` command-line flag now supports day (`d`), week (`w`) and year (`y`) suffixes in addition to the supported hour (`h`), minute (`m`) and second (`s`) suffixes. See [#50](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/50#issuecomment-3244097676).
* BUGFIX: [`/select/logsql/query` endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs): improve query performance when the `limit` query arg is set, while the `offset` query arg is missing. The issue has been introduced in [v1.28.0](#v1280). See [#620](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/620).
* BUGFIX: [`/select/logsql/facets` endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-facets): prevent incorrect swap of `hits` and `field_values` fields in [VictoriaLogs cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/). See [#648](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/648).
* BUGFIX: [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/) in [VictoriaLogs cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/): properly handle queries with [pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pipes) executed only at the `vlstorage` side without the need to post-process at the `vlselect` side. The issue has been introduced in [v1.31.0](#v1310) while working on [#52](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/52).

## [v1.32.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.32.0)

Released at 2025-09-03

* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add [`split` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#split-pipe) for splitting log fields by the given separator. It is useful for parsing CSV or tab-separated data stored in log values.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add [`running_stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#running_stats-pipe) for calculating [running sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_total), running min, running max and running count over query results.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add [`total_stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#total_stats-pipe) for calculating global sum, global min, global max and global count over query results.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add the ability to sort logs returned by [`json_values` stats function](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#json_values-stats) via `... | stats json_values() sort by (...)` syntax. The sorting can be combined with `limit N` to get the top N logs. For example, the following query returns up to the 3 most recent logs for every `host` over the last 5 minutes: `_time:5m | stats json_values() sort by (_time desc) limit 3 as last_3_host_logs`.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): return errors on typical incorrectly written queries. For example, `foo=~"bar"`, `foo~="bar"`, `foo=bar`, `foo!=bar`, `foo>bar`, `foo==bar`, etc. See [#590](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/590).
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add [substring filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#substring-filter), which searches for logs containing the given substring. Previously, the [regexp filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#regexp-filter) was used instead of the substring filter. The downside of the regexp filter is that it needs proper escaping of special regexp characters.
* FEATURE: [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/): expose `vl_storage_per_query_found_rows` [histogram](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#histogram) at the [`/metrics`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#monitoring) page, which shows the number of log entries found per query.

## [v1.31.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.31.0)

Released at 2025-08-31

* FEATURE: [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/): add `-search.maxQueryTimeRange` command-line flag, which can be used for limiting resource usage by queries with too broad [time range filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter). See [resource usage limits docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#resource-usage-limits) for details. See [#50](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/50#issuecomment-3043590508) and [#611](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/611).
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add [`query_stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#query_stats-pipe) for analyzing query execution statistics. This pipe may help you understand why the given query is slow and how to optimize it. See [#52](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/52).
* FEATURE: [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/): expose `vl_storage_per_query_read_values` [histogram](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#histogram) at the [`/metrics`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#monitoring) page, which shows the number of log field values read per query.
* FEATURE: [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/): expose `vl_storage_per_query_read_timestamps` [histogram](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#histogram) at the [`/metrics`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#monitoring) page, which shows the number of log timestamps read per query.
* FEATURE: [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/): expose `vl_storage_per_query_uncompressed_values_processed_bytes` [histogram](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#histogram) at the [`/metrics`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#monitoring) page, which shows the amount of bytes processed for uncompressed field values per query.
* FEATURE: [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/): expose `vl_storage_per_query_processed_rows` [histogram](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#histogram) at the [`/metrics`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#monitoring) page, which shows the number of log entries processed per query.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): always sort field names in alphabetical order in the JSON view. This simplifies exploring logs with a large number of fields (such as [wide events](https://jeremymorrell.dev/blog/a-practitioners-guide-to-wide-events/)). See [#87](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/87).
* FEATURE: add `/internal/partition/snapshot/create` HTTP endpoint for creating [instant snapshots](https://medium.com/@valyala/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282) for per-day partitions. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#partitions-lifecycle) for details.
* FEATURE: add `/internal/partition/snapshot/list` HTTP endpoint, which returns the list of absolute paths to snapshots created via `/internal/partition/snapshot/create`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#partitions-lifecycle) for details.
* FEATURE: add `/internal/partition/list` HTTP endpoint, which returns the list of currently active partitions. See [partition lifecycle docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#partitions-lifecycle) for details.

* BUGFIX: [querying HTTP APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/): properly return `VL-Request-Duration-Seconds` HTTP response header from [`/select/logsql/query`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs) endpoint when it returns an empty result. Previously, this header wasn't set for empty results. This is needed for [#602](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/602).

## [v1.30.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.30.0)

Released at 2025-08-27

* FEATURE: [HTTP querying APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): return the actual query execution time in the `VL-Request-Duration-Seconds` HTTP response header. This will be used for displaying the query execution time at [vlogscli](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/), at the [built-in web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui) and at [Grafana plugin for VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/integrations/grafana/).
* FEATURE: [`/select/logsql/stats_query_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-range-stats) and [`/select/logsql/hits`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-hits-stats): return `VL-Selected-Time-Range` HTTP response header, which contains the original time range specified in the query without taking into account `start` and `end` query args. The time range is returned as `[start, end]`, where `start` and `end` are Unix timestamps in nanoseconds. This header is needed for [built-in web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui) in order to adjust the displayed time range to the time range specified by the user in the query. See [#558](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/558#issuecomment-3180070712).
* FEATURE: [`/select/logsql/hits`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-hits-stats): take into account [pipes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pipes), which do not modify the [`_time` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field), when calculating hits for the given query on the given time range. Previously, all the pipes in the query were ignored. This could lead to unexpected results. For example, `* | extract "statusCode=<statusCode>," | filter statusCode:200` query was returning hits for all the logs instead of returning hits only for the logs containing the given `statusCode`. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/victorialogs-datasource/issues/308#issuecomment-3206205905).
* FEATURE: [querying HTTP APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): take into account all the [pipes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pipes) specified in the query when returning the requested field names, field values and log streams from `/select/logsql/field_names`, `/select/logsql/field_values`, `/select/logsql/stream_field_names`, `/select/logsql/stream_field_values`, `/select/logsql/streams` and `/select/logsql/stream_ids` HTTP endpoints. This makes the auto-completion results at the [built-in web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui) and at the [Grafana plugin for VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/integrations/grafana/) more expected. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/victorialogs-datasource/issues/308#issuecomment-3206205905).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): show query execution time. See [#602](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/602) for details.

* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): properly match newlines with '.' char in regular expressions used by [`extract_regexp`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#extract_regexp-pipe) and [`replace_regexp`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#replace_regexp-pipe) pipes. See [#88](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/88).
* BUGFIX: [querying HTTP APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): properly parse `end` query arg if it contains a numeric timestamp, which can be represented as [RFC3339 timestamp](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) with zero nanoseconds (e.g. only microseconds, milliseconds or seconds are non-zero). See [#587](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/587).
* BUGFIX: [vlselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/): return `502 Bad Gateway` HTTP response code when one of the `vlstorage` servers is unavailable. Previously `400 Bad Request` HTTP response code was incorrectly returned in this case. This helps build a proper failover scheme in high-availability setups for VictoriaLogs. See [#576](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/576).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix incorrect logs sorting on the Group tab. See [#579](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/579) for details.
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add button to control offset of live tailing. See [#577](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/577) for details.
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): optimize JSON tab. See [#51](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/51).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): escape value with double quotes when converting to a field filter.

## [v1.29.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.29.0)

Released at 2025-08-22

* FEATURE: introduce [Enterprise version of VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/). See [the list of Enterprise features](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/#victorialogs-enterprise-features). See also [#120](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/120).
* FEATURE: improve the scalability of data ingestion on systems with a large number of CPU cores. Previously, only up to 40 CPU cores were used during logs' ingestion into VictoriaLogs on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures, while the remaining CPU cores were idle. Remove the scalability bottleneck by switching from [musl-based](https://wiki.musl-libc.org/) to [glibc-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glibc) cross-compiler. This improved the data ingestion speed on a host with hundreds of CPU cores by more than 4x. See [#517](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/517#issuecomment-3167039079).
* FEATURE: upgrade Go builder from Go1.24.6 to Go1.25.0. See [Go1.25.0 release notes](https://go.dev/doc/go1.25).
* FEATURE: expose `vl_total_disk_space_bytes` metric at [`/metrics` page](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#monitoring), which shows the disk space size for the [`-storageDataPath` directory](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#storage). This metric can be used for calculating the percentage of the free disk space via the following [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/metricsql/) query: `vl_free_disk_space_bytes / vl_total_disk_space_bytes`.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): implement `generate_sequence` pipe, which allows generating logs with messages containing integer sequence numbers. This pipe is useful for debugging and testing LogsQL pipes. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#generate_sequence-pipe).

## [v1.28.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.28.0)

Released at 2025-08-13

* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): optimize queries ending with [`| first N by (_time desc)`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#first-pipe) and [`| last N by (_time)`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#last-pipe) in the same way as queried ending with [`| sort by (_time desc) limit N`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe) are optimized. This is a follow-up for [#46](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/46).
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add support for applying a global time offset to the `<q>` [query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#query-syntax) via `options(time_offset=<duration>) <q>` syntax. This is useful for comparing query results on some time range to query results on the same time range with the given offset (similar to the [`offset` modifier in PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#offset-modifier)). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#query-options) and [#78](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/78) for details.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add `| time_add <duration>` pipe, which allows adding the given `<duration>` to `_time` field (and to any other field). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time_add-pipe). This is a part of [#78](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/78).
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): speed up queries that select a large number of logs and end with [`| sort by (_time) desc offset M limit N` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe). These queries allow building simple pagination over the selected logs. See [#96](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/96).
* FEATURE: [VictoriaLogs cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/): use HTTP POST instead of HTTP GET method for internal VictoriaLogs cluster communication to avoid hitting too long URI limits when too long queries are passed to VictoriaLogs. See [#545](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/545).
* FEATURE: [Syslog data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/): support [rsyslog high-precision timestamps](https://docs.rsyslog.com/doc/configuration/templates.html#reserved-template-names-overview). See [#303](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/303).

* BUGFIX: [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe): properly sort logs for `| sort by (_time desc) limit N`. Previously, they were incorrectly sorted in the ascending order of `_time`, instead of in the descending order of `_time`. The bug has been introduced in [v1.27.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.27.0) when adding an optimized execution path for the `| sort by (_time desc) limit N`. See [#46](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/46).
* BUGFIX: [/select/logsql/query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs): properly return `limit=N` logs when they have identical `_time` value. Previously, an empty result could be returned in this case.
* BUGFIX: [Syslog data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/): properly parse FreeBSD dialect of Syslog messages, which may miss hostname. See [#571](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/571).

* BUGFIX: [live tailing API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#live-tailing): properly return live tailing results. Previously some of these results could be missing, while others could be returned out of order (e.g. improperly sorted by [`_time` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field)). The issue has been introduced in [v1.18.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.18.0-victorialogs).
* BUGFIX: [query API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs): properly return the last `limit` logs on the selected time range if the `limit` query arg is passed to `/select/logsql/query`. Previously logs could be returned without proper sorting because of the bug, which has been introduced in [v1.18.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.18.0-victorialogs).
* BUGFIX: [querying HTTP APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): properly drop LogsQL pipes from the provided `query` before obtaining field names and values. This is needed in order to properly implement auto-suggestion for log field names and values. See [victorialogs-datasource#308](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/victorialogs-datasource/issues/308#issuecomment-2943440419).

## [v1.23.2](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.23.2-victorialogs)

Released at 2025-05-30

* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): correctly handle `sort` pipe in queries - UI now respects the server-defined sort order instead of always sorting by time. See [#8660](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8660).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add alphabetical sorting for record fields in selectors and table view. See [#8438](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8438).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix an issue where queries were not triggered when relative time was selected and the chart was hidden. See [#8983](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8983).

Released at 2025-05-29

* BUGFIX: [multi-level cluster setup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#multi-level-cluster-setup): properly calculate [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe) functions when a `vlselect` node queries other `vlselect` nodes, which, in turn, query `vlstorage` nodes. Previously, such setup resulted in the `unexpected non-empty tail left` error for all the queries with `stats` pipe (explicit or implicit). See [#8815](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8815).

## [v1.17.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.17.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2025-03-16

**Update note: this release changes data storage format in a backwards-incompatible way, so it is impossible to downgrade to the previous releases after upgrading to this release.
It is safe to upgrade to this release and all future releases from older releases.**

* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): support zstd compression for all HTTP-based ingestion protocols. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8380) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8300) issues.
* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): allow specifying prefixes for log fields, which must be ignored during data ingestion, at `ignore_fields` HTTP query arg and at `VL-Ignore-Fields` HTTP header. For example, `ignore_fields=foo.*,bar.baz.*` will ignore all the [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model), which start from `foo.` or from `bar.baz.`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#http-parameters) for details.
* FEATURE: [stream filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream-filter): support `{label in ("v1", ..., "vN")}` and `{label not_in ("v1", ..., "vN")}` syntax. It is equivalent to `{label=~"v1|...|vN"}` and `{label!~"v1|...|vN"}` respectively, where `v1`, ... , `vN` are properly escaped inside regexp. For example, `{app in ("foo.bar","baz")}` is equivalent to `{app=~"foo\\.bar|baz"}` - note that the `.` char is properly escaped inside the regexp.
* FEATURE: improve performance when processing constant log fields with length exceeding 256 bytes. For example, repeated stack traces.

* BUGFIX: [Loki data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/promtail/): return `204 No Content` HTTP response code from `/insert/loki/api/v1/push` endpoint. Previously `200 Success` code was sent. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8505).
* BUGFIX: [OpenTelemetry data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/opentelemetry/): properly parse `trace_id` and `span_id` [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) as hex numbers. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8502) for details. Thanks to @forgethub for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8511).

## [v1.16.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.16.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2025-03-12

* FEATURE: [Loki data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/promtail/): automatically parse JSON-encoded log fields from the plaintext log message and store them as separate [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). This behavior allows achieving lower disk space usage and higher query performance compared to the case when the JSON-encoded log fields were stored in VictoriaLogs as a plaintext log message, which should be parsed at query time with [`unpack_json` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_json-pipe). The previous behavior can be restored if needed by passing the `-loki.disableMessageParsing` command-line flag to VictoriaLogs (the previous behavior isn't recommended because it is less efficient). See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8486).

* BUGFIX: [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/): properly parse floating-point numbers with leading zeroes in fractional part (for example, `12.03` or `1.0002`). Parsing for these numbers has been broken in [v1.15.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.15.0-victorialogs). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8464).
* BUGFIX: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): support floating-point timestamps for [Elasticsearch data ingestion protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#elasticsearch-bulk-api). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8470).
* BUGFIX: [OpenTelemetry data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/opentelemetry/): properly convert nested OpenTelemetry attributes into JSON. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8384).

## [v1.15.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.15.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2025-02-27

* FEATURE: [`pack_json` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pack_json-pipe): allow packing fields, which start with the given prefixes. For example, `pack_json fields (foo.*, bar.*)` creates a JSON containing all the fields, which start with either `foo.` or `bar.`.
* FEATURE: [`pack_logfmt` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pack_logfmt-pipe): allow packing fields, which start with the given prefixes. For example, `pack_logfmt fields (foo.*, bar.*)` creates [logfmt](https://brandur.org/logfmt) message containing all the fields, which start with either `foo.` or `bar.`.
* FEATURE: expose `vl_http_request_duration_seconds` [summaries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#summary) for [select APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api) at the [/metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#monitoring) page.
* FEATURE: allow passing `*` as a subquery inside [`in(*)`, `contains_any(*)` and `contains_all(*)` filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#subquery-filter). Such filters are treated as `match all` aka `*`. This will be used by [Grafana plugin for VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/integrations/grafana/). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/victorialogs-datasource/issues/238#issuecomment-2685447673).
* FEATURE: [victorialogs dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/22084): add panels to display amount of ingested logs in bytes, latency of [select APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api) calls, troubleshooting panels.
* FEATURE: provide alternative registry for all VictoriaLogs components at [Quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/victoriametrics): [VictoriaLogs](https://quay.io/repository/victoriametrics/victoria-logs?tab=tags) and [vlogscli](https://quay.io/repository/victoriametrics/vlogscli?tab=tags).

* BUGFIX: do not treat a string containing leading zeros as a number during data ingestion and querying. For example, `00123` string shouldn't be treated as `123` number. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8361).

## [v1.14.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.14.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2025-02-25

* FEATURE: add [`lt_field` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#lt_field-filter), which can be used for obtaining logs where the given [field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) value doesn't exceed the other field value.
* FEATURE: add [`le_field` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#le_field-filter), which can be used for obtaining logs where the given [field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) value is smaller or equal to the other field value.

* BUGFIX: [elasticsearch data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#elasticsearch-bulk-api): support health-check endpoint requested by Jaeger v2. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8353).
* BUGFIX: [`stats_query_range` HTTP endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-range-stats): fix inconsistent result of `stats_query_range` API. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8312).

Released at 2025-02-22

* FEATURE: add [`contains_all` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#contains_all-filter), which matches logs containing all the given words/phrases in the given [log field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).
* FEATURE: add [`contains_any` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#contains_any-filter), which matches logs containing at least one of the given words/phrases in the given [log field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).
* FEATURE: add [`eq_field` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#eq_field-filter), which can be used for obtaining logs with identical values at the given [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).
* FEATURE: add [`unpack_words` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_words-pipe) for unpacking individual [words](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#word) from the given [log field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) into the given destination field as JSON array.
* FEATURE: add [`json_array_len` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#json_array_len-pipe) for calculating the length of JSON array stored in the given [log field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).

## [v1.12.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.12.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2025-02-20

* FEATURE: [`_time` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter): allow using `>`, `>=`, `<` and `<=`. For example, `_time:<2025-02-24Z` selects all the logs with [`_time` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field) less than `2025-02-24` by UTC. Another example: `_time:>1d` selects all the logs with `_time` field older than one day from the current time. This simplifies querying VictoriaLogs.
* FEATURE: [`top` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#top-pipe): allow specifying the list of log fields without parens. For example, `top 5 foo` is equivalent to `top 5 by (foo)`.
* FEATURE: [`uniq` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#uniq-pipe): allow specifying the list of log fields without parens. For example, `uniq foo` is equivalent to `uniq (foo)`.
* FEATURE: [`unroll` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unroll-pipe): allow specifying the list of log fields without parens. For example, `unroll foo` is equivalent to `unroll (foo)`.

## [v1.11.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.11.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2025-02-19

**Update note: this release changes data storage format in a backwards-incompatible way, so it is impossible to downgrade to the previous releases after upgrading to this release.
It is safe to upgrade to this release and all future releases from older releases.**

* FEATURE: improve per-field data locality on disk. This reduces overhead related to reading data from unrelated fields during queries. This improves query performance over structured logs with a large number of fields (aka [wide events](https://jeremymorrell.dev/blog/a-practitioners-guide-to-wide-events/)) when only a small portion of fields are used in the query.
* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): reduce memory usage by up to 4x when ingesting [wide events](https://jeremymorrell.dev/blog/a-practitioners-guide-to-wide-events/) at high rate into VictoriaLogs.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add ability to limit the number of logs per page in the Group view (client-side). See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8334).

* BUGFIX: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): Fixed journald ingestion to support entities with single-character names. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8314).

## [v1.10.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.10.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2025-02-14

* BUGFIX: [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe): fix a possible `concurrent map writes` panic when using [`count_uniq`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#count_uniq-stats) and [`count_uniq_hash`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#count_uniq_hash-stats) functions over a large number of unique `stats by (...)` groups. The bug was introduced in [v1.9.0-victorialogs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.9.0-victorialogs).
* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): properly calculate `<q> | len(f) f_len | min(f_len)`. Previously, it incorrectly returned `0` if the minimum value length for `f` field is bigger than `0`.
* BUGFIX: [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe): properly calculate [stats functions with additional filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-with-additional-filters). Previously, some [stats functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe-functions) could return incorrect results if the additional filter filters out all the values in the processed data block.

## [v1.10.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.10.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2025-02-12

* FEATURE: [OpenTelemetry data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/opentelemetry/): support parsing of [`span_id`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/main/text/logs/0097-log-data-model.md#field-spanid) and [`trace_id`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/main/text/logs/0097-log-data-model.md#field-traceid) log fields. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8255) for details.
* FEATURE: [Journald data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/journald/): add support for data compression at journald side. See [this pull request](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/34822).

* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): respect the selected tenant for autocomplete suggestions. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8042).
* BUGFIX: [`stats` by time buckets](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-by-time-buckets): properly align start of the week to Monday at `stats by (_time:week) ...`. Previously, the week started on Wednesday. The start of the week can be adjusted with [offset](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-by-time-buckets-with-timezone-offset). For example, the following query aligns the start of the week to Sunday: `_time:30d | stats by (_time:week offset -1d) count() | sort by (_time)`.
* BUGFIX: [`stats` by field value buckets](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-by-field-buckets): properly calculate buckets for negative values.
* BUGFIX: [syslog data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/): correctly parse rows with allowed in rfc5424 `\]` character. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8282).

## [v1.9.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.9.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2025-02-10

* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): properly apply [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8152) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8153) bugfixes. They weren't applied to [`v1.9.0-victorialogs`](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.9.0-victorialogs) by accident.

## [v1.9.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.9.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2025-02-10

* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): improve performance for [`stats by (...) ...`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe) by up to 30% when it is applied to a large number of `by (...)` groups.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): improve performance for [`top` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#top-pipe) by up to 30% when it is applied to a large number of unique values.
* FEATURE: [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe): improve performance for [`count_uniq`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#count_uniq-stats) and [`count_uniq_hash`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#count_uniq_hash-stats) functions by up to 30% when they are applied to a large number of unique values.
* FEATURE: [`block_stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#block_stats-pipe): return the path to the part where every data block is stored. The path to the part is returned in the `part_path` field. This allows investigating the distribution of data blocks among parts.
* FEATURE: reduce VictoriaLogs startup time by multiple times when it opens a large datastore with big [retention](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#retention).
* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): accept timestamps with microsecond and nanosecond precision at [`_time` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field).
* FEATURE: [JSON lines data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#json-stream-api): continue parsing lines after encountering parse errors for some lines. Previously, the input JSON lines' stream was closed after the first parse error.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add the `_msg` field to the list of fields for the group view, allowing users to select multiple fields, including `_msg`, for log display.

* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): properly limit [`concurrency` query option](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#query-options) for [`stats`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe), [`uniq`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#uniq-pipe) and [`top`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#top-pipe). This prevents from `runtime error: index out of range` panic. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8201).
* BUGFIX: [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe): properly sort [RFC3339 timestamps](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) with variable sub-second precision. Previously, such timestamps were sorted using [natural sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order), and this could lead to unexpected results. For example, `2025-02-21T10:20:30.9Z` was incorrectly considered smaller than `2025-02-21T10:20:30.012Z`, since the last one had a higher decimal value after the last dot.
* BUGFIX: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): drop log entries with too long field names and log the dropped log entries with the `ignoring log entry with too long field name` message, so human operators could notice and fix the ingestion of incorrect logs ASAP. Previously, too long field names were silently truncated to shorter values. This isn't what most users expect. See [why VictoriaLogs has a limit on the field name length](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/faq/#what-is-the-maximum-supported-field-name-length).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix transparency for bars in the hits bar chart to improve visibility. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8152).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix `Group by field` dropdown menu not displaying any options in Group View settings. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8153).

## [v1.8.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.8.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2025-01-24

* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): add the ability to limit query concurrency for the `<q>` [query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#query-syntax) via `options(concurrency=N) <q>` syntax. This may be needed to reduce RAM and CPU usage at the cost of longer query execution times. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#query-options) for details.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): allow overriding the global time range filter at subqueries inside [`in` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#multi-exact-filter), [`join` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#join-pipe) and [`union` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#union-pipe) via `options(ignore_global_time_filter=true) <q>` syntax. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#query-options) for details.
* FEATURE: add [`hash` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#hash-pipe) for calculating hashes over the selected log fields. This may be useful for splitting the selected logs into distinct buckets. For example, the following query splits `user_id` fields into 4 buckets with the help of `hash` pipe: `_time:5m | hash(user_id) as h | math h%4 as bucket | stats by (bucket) count()`.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): reflect column settings for the table view in URL, so the table view can be shared via link. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7662).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): added context menu for legend items with options to copy and filter streams and fields. See this [PR](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7750).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): improved legend functionality with consistent click behavior across all vmui charts. See this [PR](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7750).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): added sorting for group view by record count in descending order. See this [PR](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7750).

* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): removed the ability to filter by other in the legend, as other represents an aggregated series of all streams not included in the top results. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7552).

* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): properly apply optimizations to all the subqueries. Previously, only the top-level query was optimized, while subqueries inside [`in` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#multi-exact-filter), [`join` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#join-pipe) and [`union` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#union-pipe) weren't optimized.
* BUGFIX: [HTTP querying API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): properly apply [extra filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#extra-filters) to all the subqueries. Previously, extra filters were applied only to the top-level query and weren't applied to sub-queries inside [`in` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#multi-exact-filter), [`join` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#join-pipe) and [`union` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#union-pipe).
* BUGFIX: [HTTP querying API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): properly apply time range filter from `start` and `end` args to all the subqueries. Previously, the time range filters were applied only to the top-level query and weren't applied to sub-queries inside [`in` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#multi-exact-filter), [`join` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#join-pipe) and [`union` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#union-pipe). The global time range filter can be ignored on a per-subquery basis via the `ignore_global_time_filter=true` option - see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#query-options) for details.

## [v1.7.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.7.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2025-01-20

## [v1.6.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.6.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2025-01-16

* BUGFIX: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): properly apply multiple [log stream filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream-filter). For example, `{foo="bar"} AND {baz="x"}` must correctly return logs with `foo="bar"` and `baz="x"` [log stream fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8037).

## [v1.6.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.6.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2025-01-15

* FEATURE: add [`union` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#union-pipe), which can be used for returning results from multiple independent LogsQL queries.
* FEATURE: add [`histogram` stats function](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#histogram-stats) for calculating [VictoriaMetrics histogram buckets](https://valyala.medium.com/improving-histogram-usability-for-prometheus-and-grafana-bc7e5df0e350) over the given [log field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). They will be used for building heatmaps at the [built-in Web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui) and [VictoriaLogs plugin for Grafana](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/integrations/grafana/).
* FEATURE: [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe): add `rand()` function, which can be used for generating random numbers in the range `[0 ... 1)`.

See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7761).
* BUGFIX: [vlinsert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/): order of `VL-Msg-Field` fields now defines a priority of these fields.

## [v1.4.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.4.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-12-22

* FEATURE: [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe): allow non-numeric field values at [`median`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#median-stats) and [`quantile`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#quantile-stats) stats functions.
* FEATURE: improve performance of [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe) and [`top` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#top-pipe) by up to 2x when these pipes are applied to logs with millions of unique `by (...)` groups.
* FEATURE: [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe): add [`count_uniq_hash`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#count_uniq_hash-stats) function, which counts the number of unique value hashes. This number is usually a good approximation to the number of unique values, so the `count_uniq_hash` can be used as a faster alternative to [`count_uniq`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#count_uniq-stats).
* FEATURE: [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe): improve performance of [`count_uniq`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#count_uniq-stats) and [`uniq_values`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#uniq_values-stats) functions when they are applied to fields with a large number of unique values.
* FEATURE: [`facets` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#facets-pipe): add the ability to return log fields with the same values across all the selected logs by adding the `keep_const_fields` option. Such log fields aren't interesting in most cases, so they aren't returned by default.
* FEATURE: [`in` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#multi-exact-filter): improve performance for `in(<query>)` when the `<query>` returns a large number of values.
* FEATURE: [HTTP querying APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): allow passing arbitrary [LogsQL filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filters) to `extra_filters` and `extra_stream_filters` query args. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#extra-filters) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5542) for details.
* FEATURE: [Grafana Loki data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/promtail/): add support of Loki healthcheck `/insert/ready` endpoint. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7824).
* FEATURE: [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe): return an error as soon as too many logs and/or [log streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) are passed to this pipe. This prevents excess resource usage by the `stream_context` pipe when it is improperly used. It is expected that the results of this pipe are investigated by humans, who cannot inspect surrounding logs for millions of logs passed to `stream_context`. This change addresses [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7903) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7766) issues.

* BUGFIX: [syslog data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/): correctly parse rows with multiple consecutive spaces between fields. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7776).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix cursor reset in query input field. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7288).
* BUGFIX: [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe): fix improper sorting of numeric fields in some cases.
* BUGFIX: properly return an empty minimum value from [`min` stats function](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#min-stats).

## [v1.3.2](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.3.2-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-12-09

* FEATURE: [`collapse_nums` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#collapse_nums-pipe): add the ability to prettify some patterns in collapsed numbers. For example, `<N>.<N>.<N>.<N>` is replaced with `<IP4>` when executing the `collapse_nums prettify` pipe.

* BUGFIX: [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe): fix `index out of range [0] with length 0` panic, which has been introduced in [v1.3.0-victorialogs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.3.0-victorialogs). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7762).

* BUGFIX: [`facets` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#facets-pipe): fix `assignment to entry in nil map` panic, which has been introduced in [v1.3.0-victorialogs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.3.0-victorialogs).

## [v1.3.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.3.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-12-08

* FEATURE: add [`collapse_nums` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#collapse_nums-pipe), which replaces all the decimal and hexadecimal numbers with `<N>` in the given [log field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). This can be useful for locating the most frequently seen log message patterns if log messages differ only by decimal and hexadecimal numbers (this is a very frequent case). For example, the following query returns the top 5 log message patterns seen over the last hour: `_time:1h | collapse_nums | top 5 by (_msg)`.
* FEATURE: improve performance for [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe) over [log streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) with a large number of logs (millions and more). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/244).
* FEATURE: [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe) allows changing the time window for search for surrounding logs via `time_window` option. For example, the following query searches for surrounding [log stream](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) logs on the one week window: `_time:5m error | stream_context before 10 time_window 1w`. Thanks to @worker24h for [the idea](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/244#issuecomment-3043604985).

## [v1.2.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.2.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-12-06

* FEATURE: add [`rate`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#rate-stats) and [`rate_sum`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#rate_sum-stats) stats functions, which can be used for calculating the average per-second rate of matching logs and the average per-second rate of sum over the given numeric [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7415).
* FEATURE: add [`facets` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#facets-pipe), which can be used for returning the most frequent values across all the fields seen in the selected logs. This pipe simplifies logs' exploration.
* FEATURE: add [`/select/logsql/facets` HTTP endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-facets), which returns the most frequent values across all the fields seen in the selected logs. This endpoint is going to be used for building faceted search over logs in the [VictoriaLogs web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui).

* BUGFIX: [`/select/logsql/stats_query`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats): properly apply `limit` at [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe). The bug was introduced in the release [v1.1.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.1.0-victorialogs) when fixing [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7699).
* BUGFIX: [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe): properly format expressions with multiple binary operations with the same priority. For example, `x / (y * z)` was improperly formatted as `x / y * z`, while `x - (y + z)` was improperly formatted as `x - y + z`. This could lead to incorrect query results in [vlogscli](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/).

## [v1.1.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.1.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-12-05

* FEATURE: add [`first`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#first-pipe) and [`last`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#last-pipe) pipes for returning the first `N` and the last `N` logs after sorting them by the given set of [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). For example, the following query returns up to 5 logs with the biggest value for `request_duration` over the last hour: `_time:1h | last 5 by (request_duration)`.
* FEATURE: [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe): add the ability to apply `limit` individually per group of logs via `partition by (...)` syntax. For example, the following query returns up to 3 logs with the smallest `request_duration` for each `host`: `_time:5m | sort by (request_duration) limit 3 partition by (host)`.
* FEATURE: [format pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#format-pipe): allow formatting log fields in lowercase and uppercase via `<uc:field_name>` and `<lc:field_name>` syntax. This can be useful when some fields must be consistently transformed to the same case during querying. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/245#issuecomment-3043604853).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add frontend-only pagination for table view.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): improve memory consumption during data processing. This enhancement reduces the overall memory footprint, leading to better performance and stability.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): reduce memory usage across all tabs for improved performance and stability. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7185).
* FEATURE: [Grafana Loki data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/promtail/): use Loki [stream labels](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/labels/) as VictoriaLogs [stream fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) by default. The set of stream fields can be overridden via `_stream_fields` query arg or via `VL-Stream-Fields` header as described [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#http-parameters).
* FEATURE: [OpenTelemetry data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/opentelemetry/): use [resource labels](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/resources/) as VictoriaLogs [stream fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) by default. The set of stream fields can be overridden via `_stream_fields` query arg or via `VL-Stream-Fields` header as described [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#http-parameters).
* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): expose `vl_bytes_ingested_total` [counter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#counter) at `/metrics` page. This counter tracks an estimated number of bytes processed when parsing the ingested logs. This counter is exposed individually per every [supported data ingestion protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/) - the protocol name is exposed in the `type` label. For example, `vl_bytes_ingested_total{type="jsonline"}` tracks an estimated number of bytes processed when reading the ingested logs via [json line protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#json-stream-api). Thanks to @tenmozes for the idea and [the initial implementation](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7682).
* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): expose `vl_too_long_lines_skipped_total` [counter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#counter) at `/metrics` page. This counter tracks the number of ingested lines with the length bigger than the value of `-insert.maxLineSizeBytes` command-line flag. Such lines are ignored.

* BUGFIX: [`/select/logsql/stats_query_range` API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-range-stats): properly handle the [`limit` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#limit-pipe) after the [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe). Previously, the `limit` was applied globally across all calculated stats, while it must be applied individually for each `step` on the `start ... end` time range. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7699).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix for `showLegend` and `alias` flags in predefined panels. [See this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7565)
* BUGFIX: fix a `too many columns detected in the block` panic when the ingested logs contain more than 2000 fields with different names per [log stream](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7568) for details.
* BUGFIX: properly parse lines after too long [JSON lines](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#json-stream-api) and [Elasticsearch lines](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#elasticsearch-bulk-api) with the length exceeding `-insert.maxLineSizeBytes`. Previously, all the lines after the too long line in the stream were ignored.

## [v1.0.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.0.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-11-12

This release is identical to [v0.42.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.42.0-victorialogs).

VictoriaLogs gained all [the planned features](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/)
since the [initial v0.1.0 release](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.1.0-victorialogs) 1.5 years ago,
and is ready for production!

## [v0.42.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.42.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-11-08

* FEATURE: [`join` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#join-pipe): add the ability to add a prefix to all log field names from the joined query by using the `| join by (<by_fields>) (<query>) prefix "some_prefix"` syntax.
* FEATURE: [`_time` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter): allow specifying offset without time range. For example, `_time:offset 1d` matches all the logs until `now-1d` in the [`_time` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field). This is useful when building graphs for time ranges with some offset in the past.
* FEATURE: [`/select/logsql/tail` HTTP endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): support for `offset` query arg, which can be used for delayed emission of matching logs during live tailing. Thanks to @Fusl for the initial idea and implementation in [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7428).
* FEATURE: [vlogscli](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/): allow enabling and disabling wrapping of long lines, which do not fit screen width, with `\wrap_long_lines` command.
* FEATURE: [syslog data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/): allow overriding default [stream fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) with the given [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) during data ingestion. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/#stream-fields). See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7480).
* FEATURE: [syslog data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/): allow adding arbitrary [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) via `[label1=value1 ... labelN=valueN]` syntax inside Syslog messages. For example, `<165>1 2024-06-03T17:42:00.000Z example.com appname 12345 ID47 [field1=value1 field2=value2] some message`.
* FEATURE: [syslog data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/): allow dropping the specified [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) during data ingestion. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/#dropping-fields).
* FEATURE: [syslog data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/): allow adding the specified [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) during data ingestion. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/#adding-extra-fields). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7354).
* FEATURE: [Loki data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#loki-json-api): show the original request body on parse errors. This should simplify debugging. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7490).

* BUGFIX: [`values` stats function](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#values-stats): fix a bug, which could lead to corrupted results. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7458).
* BUGFIX: [`uniq_values`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#uniq_values-stats), [`min`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#min-stats), [`max`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#max-stats), [`row_min`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#row_min-stats) and [`row_max`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#row_max-stats) stats functions: fix a bug, which could return non-matching field values for these functions. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7458).
* BUGFIX: [HTTP querying APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api): properly take into account the `end` query arg when calculating time range for [`_time:duration` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter). Previously, the `_time:duration` filter was treated as `_time:[now-duration, now)`, while it should be treated as `_time:[end-duration, end)`.

## [v0.41.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.41.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-11-06

* FEATURE: support [structured metadata](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/labels/structured-metadata/) when ingesting logs with [Grafana Loki ingestion protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/promtail/). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7431).
* FEATURE: add [`join` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#join-pipe), which can be used for performing SQL-like joins.
* FEATURE: support returning historical logs from [live tailing API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#live-tailing) via `start_offset` query arg. For example, request to `/select/logsql/tail?query=*&start_offset=5m` returns logs for the last 5 minutes before starting to return live tailing logs for the given `query`.
* FEATURE: add the ability to specify extra fields for logs ingested via [HTTP-based data ingestion protocols](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#http-apis). See the `extra_fields` query arg and `VL-Extra-Fields` HTTP header in [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#http-parameters).
* FEATURE: add [`block_stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#block_stats-pipe) for returning various per-block stats. This pipe is useful for debugging.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add sorting of logs by groups and within each group by time in desc order. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7184) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7045).
* FEATURE: add support for receiving DataDog logs over network. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6632).

* BUGFIX: properly sort fields with floating-point numbers by [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe). Previously, floating-point numbers could be improperly sorted because they were treated as strings, and [natural sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order) was incorrectly applied to them. For example, `0.123` was treated as bigger than `0.9`.

## [v0.40.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.40.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-10-31

* FEATURE: add support for extra filters across all the [HTTP querying APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#extra-filters) for details. This is needed for implementing quick filtering on field values at [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7365).

* BUGFIX: properly apply [`replace`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#replace-pipe) and [`replace_regexp`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#replace_regexp-pipe) pipes to identical values in adjacent log entries. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7162).
* BUGFIX: properly apply [`extract`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#extract-pipe) and [`extract_regexp`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#extract_regexp-pipe) pipe with additional `if (...)` filter (aka [conditional extract](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#conditional-extract) and [conditional extract_regexp](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#conditional-extract_regexp)).

## [v0.39.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.39.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-10-30

* FEATURE: allow specifying a list of log fields, which may contain log messages, via `_msg_field` query arg and via `VL-Msg-Field` HTTP request header. For example, `_msg_field=message,event.message` instructs obtaining [message field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#message-field) from the first non-empty field out of the `message` and `event.message` fields. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#http-parameters) for details.
* FEATURE: accept logs without [`_msg` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#message-field). In this case, the `_msg` field is automatically set to the value specified in the `-defaultMsgValue` command-line flag.

* BUGFIX: fix `runtime error: index out of range [0] with length 0` panic during low-rate data ingestion. The panic has been introduced in [v0.38.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.38.0-victorialogs). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7391).

## [v0.38.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.38.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-10-29

* FEATURE: added the ability to receive systemd (journald) logs over the network. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4618).
* FEATURE: improve performance for queries over a large volume of logs with a large number of [fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) (aka `wide events`).
* FEATURE: improve performance for [`/select/logsql/field_values` HTTP endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-field-values).
* FEATURE: improve performance for [`field_values` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#field_values-pipe) when it is applied directly to [log filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filters).
* FEATURE: add the ability to return the `rank` field from the [`top` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#top-pipe). For example, the following query returns the `1..5` rank for each returned `ip` with the largest number of logs over the last 5 minutes: `_time:5m | top 5 by (ip) rank`.

* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix various glitches with updating query responses. The issue was introduced in [v0.36.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.36.0-victorialogs). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7279).

## [v0.37.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.37.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-10-18

* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add ability to hide hits chart. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7117).
* FEATURE: add basic [alerting rules](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/blob/master/deployment/docker/rules/alerts-vlogs.yml) for VictoriaLogs process. See details at [monitoring docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#monitoring).
* FEATURE: improve [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe) performance on systems with many CPU cores when `by(...)` fields contain a large number of unique values. For example, `_time:1d | stats by (user_id) count() x` should be executed much faster when the `user_id` field contains millions of unique values.
* FEATURE: improve performance for [`top`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#top-pipe), [`uniq`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#uniq-pipe) and [`field_values`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#field_values-pipe) pipes on systems with many CPU cores when applied to [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) with a large number of unique values. For example, `_time:1d | top 5 (user_id)` should be executed much faster when the `user_id` field contains millions of unique values.
* FEATURE: improve performance for [`field_names` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#field_names-pipe) when it is applied to logs with hundreds of [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).

* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix display of hits chart. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7133).

## [v0.36.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.36.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-10-16

* FEATURE: optimize [LogsQL queries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) that need to scan a large number of logs with a large number of [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) (aka `wide events`). Performance for such queries is improved by 10x or more, depending on the number of log fields in the scanned logs. The performance improvement is visible when querying logs ingested after upgrading to this release.
* FEATURE: add support for forced merge. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#forced-merge).
* FEATURE: skip empty log fields in query results, since they are treated as non-existing fields in [VictoriaLogs data model](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). This should reduce the level of confusion for end users when they see empty log fields.
* FEATURE: allow using [`format` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#format-pipe) for creating output labels from existing log fields at [`/select/logsql/stats_query`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats) and [`/select/logsql/stats_query_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-range-stats) endpoints.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add the ability to cancel running queries. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7097).

* BUGFIX: avoid possible panic when logs for a new day are ingested during execution of concurrent queries.
* BUGFIX: avoid panic at `lib/logstorage.(*blockResultColumn).forEachDictValue()` when the query contains [stats with additional filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-with-additional-filters). The panic has been introduced in [v0.33.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.33.0-victorialogs) in [this commit](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/commit/a350be48b68330ee1a487e1fb09b002d3be45163).
* BUGFIX: add more checks for [stats query APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats) to avoid invalid results.
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix error messages rendering from overflowing the screen with long messages. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7207).

## [v0.35.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.35.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-10-09

* FEATURE: [vlogscli](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/): add ability to live tail query results - see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/#live-tailing).
* FEATURE: [vlogscli](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/): add compact output mode for query results. It can be enabled by typing `\c` and then pressing `enter`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/#output-modes).
* FEATURE: [vlogscli](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/): add `-accountID` and `-projectID` command-line flags for setting `AccountID` and `ProjectID` values when querying the specific [tenants](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#multitenancy).

## [v0.34.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.34.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-10-08

* FEATURE: [vlogscli](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/): add ability to display results in `logfmt` mode, single-line and multi-line JSON modes according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/#output-modes).
* FEATURE: [vlogscli](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/): preserve `less` output after the exit from scrolling mode. This should help re-use previous query results in subsequent queries.
* FEATURE: add [`len` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#len-pipe) for calculating the length for the given [log field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) value in bytes.

## [v0.33.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.33.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-10-01

* FEATURE: add interactive command-line tool for querying VictoriaLogs - [`vlogscli`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/).

* BUGFIX: [`count_uniq` stats function](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#count_uniq-stats): do not count field values, which aren't matched by the used filters. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7152).

## [v0.32.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.32.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-09-30

* BUGFIX: do not return field values with zero matching logs from [`field_values`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#field_values-pipe), [`top`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#top-pipe) and [`uniq`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#uniq-pipe) pipes. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/victorialogs-datasource/issues/72#issuecomment-2352078483).

## [v0.32.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.32.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-09-29

* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): accept Unix timestamps in seconds in the ingested logs. This simplifies integration with systems that prefer Unix timestamps over text-based representations of time.
* FEATURE: [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe): allow using `order` alias instead of `sort`. For example, `_time:5s | order by (_time)` query works the same as `_time:5s | sort by (_time)`. This simplifies [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) transition from SQL-like query languages.
* FEATURE: [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe): allow using multiple identical [stats functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe-functions) with distinct [filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-with-additional-filters) and automatically generated result names. For example, `_time:5m | count(), count() if (error)` query works as expected now, e.g., it returns two results over the last 5 minutes: the total number of logs and the number of logs with `error` [word](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#word). Previously, this query couldn't be executed because the `if (...)` condition wasn't included in the automatically-generated result name, so both results had the same name - `count(*)`.

* BUGFIX: properly calculate [`uniq`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#uniq-pipe) and [`top`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#top-pipe) pipes. Previously, they could return invalid results in some cases.

## [v0.31.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.31.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-09-27

* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): improved readability of staircase graphs and tooltip usability. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/335#issuecomment-3043609994).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): simplify query input by adding only the label name when `ctrl`+clicking the line legend. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/335#issuecomment-3043609994).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): keep selected columns in table view on page reloads. Before, selected columns were reset on each update. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7016).
* FEATURE: allow skipping `_stream:` prefix in [stream filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream-filter). This simplifies writing queries with stream filters. Now `{foo="bar"}` is the recommended format for stream filters over the `_stream:{foo="bar"}` format.
* FEATURE: allow using `-` instead of `!` as `NOT` operator shorthand in [logical filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#logical-filter). For example, `-info -warn` query is equivalent to `!info !warn`. This simplifies the transition from other query languages with full-text search support, which usually use `-` as `NOT` operator.

## [v0.30.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.30.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-09-27

* BUGFIX: consistently return matching log streams sorted by time from [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe). Previously, log streams could be returned in arbitrary order with every request. This could complicate using `stream_context` pipe.
* BUGFIX: [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe): add missing `_msg="---"` delimiter between stream contexts belonging to different [log streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields). This should simplify investigating `stream_context` output for multiple matching log streams.

## [v0.30.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.30.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-09-27

* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add button for enabling auto refresh, similarly to VictoriaMetrics vmui. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7017).
* FEATURE: drop logs without [`_msg`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#message-field) field or with empty `_msg` field, since this field is required to be non-empty in [VictoriaLogs data model](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6785).
* FEATURE: improve performance of analytical queries, which do not need to read the `_time` field. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7070).
* FEATURE: add [`blocks_count` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#blocks_count-pipe), which can be used for counting the number of matching blocks for the given query. For example, `_time:5m | blocks_count` returns the number of blocks with logs for the last 5 minutes. This pipe can be useful for debugging purposes.
* FEATURE: support [ingesting logs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/) with `_time` field, which doesn't contain timezone information. For example, `2024-09-20T10:20:30`. In this case, the local timezone of the host where VictoriaLogs runs is used. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6721).
* FEATURE: reduce memory usage when [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe) is applied to [log streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) with a large number of messages. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6730).

* BUGFIX: fix Windows build, which has been broken in [v0.29.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.29.0-victorialogs). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6973).
* BUGFIX: properly return logs from [`/select/logsql/tail` endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#live-tailing) if the query contains [`_time:some_duration` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter) like `_time:5m`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7028). The bug has been introduced in [v0.29.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.29.0-victorialogs).
* BUGFIX: properly return logs without [`_msg`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#message-field) field when `*` query is passed to [`/select/logsql/query` endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs) together with positive `limit` arg. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6785). Thanks to @jiekun for identifying the root cause of the issue.
* BUGFIX: support [ingesting logs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/) with `_time` field containing whitespace delimiter between the date and time instead of `T` delimiter. For example, `2024-09-20 10:20:30`. This is valid [ISO8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) aka `SQL datetime` format, which sometimes is used in production. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6721).
* BUGFIX: return all the requested surrounding logs for [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe). Previously, only logs matching the [`_time` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter) were returned. This is needed for [this feature](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7063).

## [v0.29.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.29.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-09-08

* FEATURE: add [`/select/logsql/stats_query` HTTP API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats), which is going to be used by [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/) for executing alerting and recording rules against VictoriaLogs.

* FEATURE: optimize [multi-exact queries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#multi-exact-filter) with many phrases to search. For example, `ip:in(path:="/foo/bar" | keep ip)` when there are many unique values for `ip` field among log entries with `/foo/bar` path.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add support for displaying the top 5 log streams in the hits graph. The remaining log streams are grouped into an "other" label. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/335).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add the ability to customize the graph display with options for bar, line, stepped line, and points.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add fields for setting AccountID and ProjectID. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6631).

* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add the ability to select all columns in the column display settings of the table. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6668). Thanks to @yincongcyincong for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6680).
* FEATURE: Allow to define ingestion parameters via headers. Supported headers - `VL-Msg-Field`,`VL-Stream-Fields`,`VL-Ignore-Fields`,`VL-Time-Field`, `VL-Debug`. See this [PR](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6443) for details.
* FEATURE: [vlinsert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/): added OpenTelemetry logs ingestion support. See this [PR](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6218) for details.

* BUGFIX: properly handle Logstash requests for Elasticsearch configuration when using `outputs.elasticsearch` in Logstash pipelines. Previously, the requests could be rejected with `400 Bad Request` response. Updates [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4750).
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix `not found index.js` error when loading vmui in VictoriaLogs. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6764). Thanks to @yincongcyincong for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6770).
* BUGFIX: properly execute queries with `OR` [filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#logical-filter) for distinct [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). For example, `field1:foo OR field2:bar`. Previously, logs matching these filters may be skipped during querying. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6554) for details. Thanks to @yincongcyincong for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6556).

## [v0.28.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.28.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-07-10

* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): show a spinner on top of bar chart until user's request is finished. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6558).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): use compact representation of JSON lines at `JSON` tab if only a single [log field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) is queried. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6559).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): properly show the number of matching logs on the selected time range at bar chart for queries with arbitrary [pipes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pipes), including [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe) and [`top` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#top-pipe).

## [v0.27.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.27.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-07-05

* BUGFIX: properly JSON-encode strings with special chars in [HTTP querying API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api) responses. This fixes the `error decode response: invalid character 'x' in string escape code` error in [VictoriaLogs datasource for Grafana](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/victorialogs-datasource/). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/victorialogs-datasource/issues/24). The issue has been introduced in the release [v0.9.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.9.0-victorialogs).

## [v0.27.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.27.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-07-02

* FEATURE: add `-syslog.useLocalTimestamp.tcp` and `-syslog.useLocalTimestamp.udp` command-line flags, which could be used for using the local timestamp as [`_time` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field) for the logs ingested via the corresponding `-syslog.listenAddr.tcp` / `-syslog.listenAddr.udp`. By default, the timestamp from the syslog message is used as [`_time` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/).

* BUGFIX: make slowly ingested logs visible for search as soon as they are ingested into VictoriaLogs. Previously, slowly ingested logs could remain invisible for search for a long time.

## [v0.26.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.26.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-07-01

* BUGFIX: return the proper surrounding logs for [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe) when additional [pipes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pipes) are put after the `stream_context` pipe. This has been broken in [v0.26.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.26.0-victorialogs).

## [v0.26.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.26.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-07-01

* FEATURE: add ability to return log position (aka rank) after sorting logs with [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe). This can be done by adding `rank as <fieldName>` to the end of `| sort ...` pipe. For example, `_time:5m | sort by (_time) rank as position` instructs storing the position of every sorted log line into `position` [field name](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).
* FEATURE: add delimiter log with `---` message between log chunks returned by [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe). This should simplify the investigation of the returned logs.
* FEATURE: reduce memory usage when a large number of context logs are requested from the [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe).

## [v0.25.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.25.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-28

* FEATURE: add ability to select surrounding logs in front and after the selected logs via [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe). This functionality may be useful for investigating stacktraces, panics or some correlated log messages. This functionality is similar to `grep -A` and `grep -B`.
* FEATURE: add ability to return top `N` `"fields"` groups from  [`/select/logsql/hits` HTTP endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-hits-stats), by specifying `fields_limit=N` query arg. This query arg will be used in [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/335).

* BUGFIX: fix `runtime error: index out of range [0] with length 0` panic when empty lines are ingested via [Syslog format](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/) by Cisco controllers. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6548).

## [v0.24.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.24.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-27

* FEATURE: add `/select/logsql/tail` HTTP endpoint, which can be used for live tailing of [LogsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) results. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#live-tailing) for details.
* FEATURE: add `/select/logsql/stream_ids` HTTP endpoint, which can be used for returning [`_stream_id` values](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) with the number of hits for the given [LogsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-stream_ids) for details.
* FEATURE: add `-retention.maxDiskSpaceUsageBytes` command-line flag, which allows limiting disk space usage for [VictoriaLogs data](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#storage) by automatically dropping the oldest per-day partitions if the storage disk space usage becomes bigger than the `-retention.maxDiskSpaceUsageBytes`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#retention-by-disk-space-usage).

* BUGFIX: properly take into account query timeout specified via `-search.maxQueryDuration` command-line flag and/or via `timeout` query arg. Previously, these timeouts could be ignored during query execution.
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix the update of the relative time range when `Execute Query` is clicked. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6345).

## [v0.23.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.23.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-25

* FEATURE: [syslog data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/): parse [STRUCTURED-DATA](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5424#section-6.3) into `SD-ID.field1=value1`, `SD-ID.field2=value2`, ..., `SD-ID.fieldN=valueN` [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). Previously, the `STRUCTURED-DATA` was parsed into a single log field with the `SD-ID` name and `field1=value1 field2=value2 ... fieldN=valueN` value. This could complicate the querying of such data.

* BUGFIX: properly parse timestamps with timezones during [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/) and [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/). This has been broken in [v0.20.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.20.0-victorialogs). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6508).

## [v0.22.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.22.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-24

* FEATURE: allow specifying multiple `_stream_id` values in [`_stream_id` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#_stream_id-filter) via `_stream_id:in(id1, ..., idN)` syntax.
* FEATURE: allow specifying subquery for searching for `_stream_id` values inside [`_stream_id` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#_stream_id-filter). For example, `_stream_id:in(_time:5m error | fields _stream_id)` returns logs for [logs streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) with the `error` word across logs for the last 5 minutes.

## [v0.21.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.21.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-20

* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add a bar chart displaying the number of log entries over a time range. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6404).
* FEATURE: expose `_stream_id` field, which uniquely identifies [log streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields). This field can be used to quickly obtain all the logs belonging to a particular stream via [`_stream_id` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#_stream_id-filter).

## [v0.20.2](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.20.2-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-18

* BUGFIX: properly parse timestamps with nanosecond precision for logs ingested via [jsonline format](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#json-stream-api). The bug has been introduced in [v0.20.0 release](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.20.0-victorialogs).

## [v0.20.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.20.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-18

* FEATURE: allow configuring multiple receivers with distinct configs for syslog messages. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/#multiple-configs).

* BUGFIX: properly read syslog messages over TCP and TLS connections according to [RFC5425](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5425) when [data ingestion for syslog protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/) is enabled.

## [v0.20.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.20.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-17

* FEATURE: add ability to accept logs in [Syslog format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/).
* FEATURE: add ability to specify timezone offset when parsing [rfc3164](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3164) syslog messages with [`unpack_syslog` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_syslog-pipe).
* FEATURE: add [`top` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#top-pipe) for returning top N sets of the given fields with the maximum number of matching log entries.

## [v0.19.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.19.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-11

* FEATURE: do not allow starting the [filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filters) with [pipe names](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pipes) and [stats function names](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe-functions). This prevents unexpected results returned by incorrect queries, which miss mandatory [filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#query-syntax).
* FEATURE: treat unexpected syslog message as [RFC3164](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3164) containing only the `message` field when using [`unpack_syslog` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_syslog-pipe).
* FEATURE: allow using `where` prefix instead of `filter` prefix in [`filter` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filter-pipe).
* FEATURE: disallow unescaped `!` char in [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) queries, since it permits writing incorrect queries, which may look like correct ones. For example, `foo!:bar` instead of `foo:!bar`.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add markdown support to the `Group` view. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6292).

* BUGFIX: return back the improved performance for queries with `*` filters (aka `SELECT *`). This has been broken in [v0.16.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.16.0-victorialogs).

## [v0.18.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.18.0-victorialogs)

These filters allow selecting logs on a particular time range per day or on a particular day of the week.
* FEATURE: allow using `eval` instead of `math` keyword in [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe).

## [v0.17.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.17.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-05

* FEATURE: add [`pack_logfmt` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pack_logfmt-pipe) for formatting [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) into [logfmt](https://brandur.org/logfmt) messages.
* FEATURE: allow using IPv4 addresses in [range comparison filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#range-comparison-filter). For example, `ip:>'12.34.56.78'` is a valid filter now.
* FEATURE: add `ceil()` and `floor()` functions to [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe).
* FEATURE: add support for bitwise `and`, `or` and `xor` operations at [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe).
* FEATURE: add support for automatic conversion of [RFC3339 time](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) and IPv4 addresses into numeric representation at [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe).
* FEATURE: add ability to format numeric fields into string representation of time, duration and IPv4 with [`format` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#format-pipe).
* FEATURE: set `format` field to `rfc3164` or `rfc5424` depending on the [Syslog format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) parsed via [`unpack_syslog` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_syslog-pipe).

* BUGFIX: always respect the limit set in [`limit` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#limit-pipe). Previously, the limit could be exceeded in some cases.

## [v0.16.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.16.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-04

* FEATURE: add [`unpack_syslog` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_syslog-pipe) for unpacking [syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) messages from [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).
* FEATURE: parse timestamps in [`_time` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter) with nanosecond precision.
* FEATURE: return the last `N` matching logs from [`/select/logsql/query` HTTP API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs) with the maximum timestamps if `limit=N` query arg is passed to it. Previously, a random subset of matching logs could be returned, which could complicate the investigation of the returned logs.
* FEATURE: add [`drop_empty_fields` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#drop_empty_fields-pipe) for dropping [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) with empty values.

## [v0.15.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.15.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-05-30

* FEATURE: add [`row_any`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#row_any-stats) function for [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe). This function returns a sample log entry for every calculated [group of results](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-by-fields).
* FEATURE: add `default` operator to [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe). It allows overriding `NaN` results with the given default value.
* FEATURE: add `exp()` and `ln()` functions to [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe).
* FEATURE: allow omitting result name in [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe) expressions. In this case, the result name is automatically set to the string representation of the corresponding math expression. For example, `_time:5m | math duration / 1000` is equivalent to `_time:5m | math (duration / 1000) as "duration / 1000"`.
* FEATURE: allow omitting result name in [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe). In this case, the result name is automatically set to the string representation of the corresponding [stats function expression](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe-functions). For example, `_time:5m | count(*)` is valid [LogsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) now. It is equivalent to `_time:5m | stats count(*) as "count(*)"`.

* BUGFIX: properly calculate the number of matching rows in `* | field_values x | stats count() rows` and in `* | unroll (x) | stats count() rows` queries.

## [v0.14.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.14.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-05-29

* FEATURE: allow specifying fields, which must be packed into JSON in [`pack_json` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pack_json-pipe) via `pack_json fields (field1, ..., fieldN)` syntax.

* BUGFIX: properly apply `if (...)` filters to calculated results in [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe) when [grouping by fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-by-fields) is enabled. For example, `_time:5m | stats by (host) count() logs, count() if (error) errors` now properly calculates per-`host` `errors`.

## [v0.13.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.13.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-05-28

* FEATURE: add [`extract_regexp` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#extract_regexp-pipe) for extracting arbitrary substrings from [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) with [RE2 regular expressions](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).
* FEATURE: add [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe) for mathematical calculations over [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).
* FEATURE: add [`field_values` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#field_values-pipe), which returns unique values for the given [log field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).
* FEATURE: allow omitting `stats` prefix in [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe). For example, `_time:5m | count() rows` is a valid query now. It is equivalent to `_time:5m | stats count() as rows`.
* FEATURE: allow omitting `filter` prefix in [`filter` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filter-pipe) if the filter doesn't clash with [pipe names](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pipes). For example, `_time:5m | stats by (host) count() rows | rows:>1000` is a valid query now. It is equivalent to `_time:5m | stats by (host) count() rows | filter rows:>1000`.
* FEATURE: allow [`head` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#limit-pipe) without a number. For example, `error | head`. In this case, the first 10 values are returned as `head`. Unix command does this by default.
* FEATURE: allow using [comparison filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#range-comparison-filter) with strings. For example, `some_text_field:>="foo"` matches [log entries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) with `some_text_field` field values bigger or equal to `foo`.

## [v0.12.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.12.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-05-26

* FEATURE: add support for comments in multi-line LogsQL queries. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#comments).

This bug has been introduced in [v0.12.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.12.0-victorialogs).

## [v0.12.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.12.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-05-26

* FEATURE: add [`pack_json` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pack_json-pipe), which packs all the [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) into a JSON object and stores it into the given field.
* FEATURE: add [`unroll` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unroll-pipe), which can be used for unrolling JSON arrays stored in [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).
* FEATURE: add [`replace_regexp` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#replace_regexp-pipe), which allows updating [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) with regular expressions.
* FEATURE: improve performance for [`format`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#format-pipe) and [`extract`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#extract-pipe) pipes.
* FEATURE: improve performance for [`/select/logsql/field_names` HTTP API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-field-names).

* BUGFIX: prevent from panic in [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe) when VictoriaLogs runs on a system with one CPU core.
* BUGFIX: do not return referenced fields if they weren't present in the original logs. For example, `_time:5m | format if (non_existing_field:"") "abc"` could return an empty `non_exiting_field`, while it shouldn't be returned because it is missing in the original logs.
* BUGFIX: properly initialize values for [`in(...)` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#multi-exact-filter) inside [`filter` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filter-pipe) if the `in(...)` contains other [filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filters). For example, `_time:5m | filter ip:in(user_type:admin | fields ip)` now works correctly.

## [v0.11.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.11.0-victorialogs)

* FEATURE: add [`replace` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#replace-pipe), which allows replacing substrings in [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).
* FEATURE: support [comparing](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#range-filter) log field values with [special numeric values](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#numeric-values). For example, `duration:>1.5s` and `response_size:<15KiB` are valid filters now.
* FEATURE: properly sort [durations](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#duration-values) and [short numeric values](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#short-numeric-values) in [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe). For example, `10s` goes in front of `1h`, while `10KB` goes in front of `1GB`.
* FEATURE: add the ability to preserve the original non-empty field values when executing the [`extract`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#extract-pipe), [`unpack_json`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_json-pipe), [`unpack_logfmt`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_logfmt-pipe) and [`format`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#format-pipe) pipes.
* FEATURE: add the ability to preserve the original field values if the corresponding unpacked values are empty when executing the [`extract`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#extract-pipe), [`unpack_json`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_json-pipe), [`unpack_logfmt`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_logfmt-pipe) and [`format`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#format-pipe) pipes.

## [v0.10.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.10.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-05-24

* FEATURE: return the number of matching log entries per returned value in [HTTP API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api) results. This simplifies detecting [field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) / [stream](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) values with the biggest number of logs for the given [LogsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/).
* FEATURE: improve performance for [regexp filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#regexp-filter) in the following cases:
  * If the regexp contains just a phrase without special regular expression chars. For example, `~"foo"`.
  * If the regexp starts with `.*` or ends with `.*`. For example, `~".*foo.*"`.
  * If the regexp contains multiple strings delimited by `|`. For example, `~"foo|bar|baz"`.
  * If the regexp contains multiple [words](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#word). For example, `~"foo bar baz"`.
* FEATURE: allow disabling automatic unquoting of the matched placeholders in [`extract` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#extract-pipe). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#format-for-extract-pipe-pattern).

* BUGFIX: properly parse `!` in front of [exact filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#exact-filter), [exact-prefix filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#exact-prefix-filter) and [regexp filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#regexp-filter). For example, `!~"some regexp"` is properly parsed as `not ="some regexp"`. Previously it was incorrectly parsed as `'~="some regexp"'` [phrase filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#phrase-filter).
* BUGFIX: properly sort results by [`_time` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field) when [`limit` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#limit-pipe) is applied. For example, `_time:5m | sort by (_time) desc | limit 10` properly works now.

* BUGFIX: properly return matching logs in [streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) with small number of entries. Previously, they could be skipped. The issue has been introduced in [the release v0.6.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.6.0-victorialogs).
* BUGFIX: fix `runtime error: index out of range` panic when using [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe) like `_time:1h | sort by (_time)`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6258).

## [v0.6.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.6.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-05-12

* FEATURE: return all the log fields by default in query results. Previously only [`_stream`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields), [`_time`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field) and [`_msg`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#message-field) fields were returned by default.
* FEATURE: add support for returning only the requested log [fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#fields-pipe).
* FEATURE: add support for calculating various stats over [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). Grouping by an arbitrary set of [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) is supported. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe) for details.
* FEATURE: add support for sorting the returned results. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe).
* FEATURE: add support for returning unique results. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#uniq-pipe).
* FEATURE: add support for limiting the number of returned results. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#limiters).
* FEATURE: add support for copying and renaming the selected log fields. See [these](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#copy-pipe) and [these](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#rename-pipe) docs.
* FEATURE: allow using `_` inside numbers. For example, `score:range[1_000, 5_000_000]` for [`range` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#range-filter).
* FEATURE: allow numbers in hexadecimal and binary form. For example, `response_size:range[0xff, 0b10001101101]` for [`range` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#range-filter).
* FEATURE: allow using duration and byte size suffixes in numeric values inside LogsQL queries. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#numeric-values).
* FEATURE: improve data ingestion performance by up to 50%.
* FEATURE: optimize performance for [LogsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/), which contains multiple filters for [words](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#word-filter) or [phrases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#phrase-filter) delimited with [`AND` operator](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#logical-filter). For example, `foo AND bar` query must find [log messages](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#message-field) with `foo` and `bar` words at faster speed.

* BUGFIX: prevent from possible corruption of short [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) during data ingestion.
* BUGFIX: prevent from additional CPU usage for up to a few seconds after canceling the query.
* BUGFIX: prevent from returning log entries with empty `_stream` field in the form `"_stream":""` in [search query results](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6042).

## [v0.5.2](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.5.2-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-04-11

* BUGFIX: properly register new [log streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) under high data ingestion rate. The issue has been introduced in [v0.5.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.5.0-victorialogs).

## [v0.5.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.5.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-04-04

* BUGFIX: properly apply time range filter for queries containing [`OR` operators](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#logical-filter). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5920).
* BUGFIX: do not log debug lines `DEBUG: start trimLines` and `DEBUG: end trimLines`. This bug has been introduced in [v0.5.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.5.0-victorialogs) in [this commit](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/commit/0514091948cf8e00e42f44318c0e5e5b63b6388f).

## [v0.5.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.5.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-03-01

* FEATURE: support the ability to limit the number of returned log entries from [HTTP querying API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api) by passing `limit` query arg. Previously, all the matching log entries were returned until the response stream was closed. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5674). Thanks to @dmitryk-dk for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5778).

* BUGFIX: do not panic on incorrect regular expression in [stream filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream-filter). Thanks to @XLONG96 for [the bugfix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5897).
* BUGFIX: properly determine when the assisted merge is needed. Previously, logs that determined whether the assisted merge was needed were broken. This could lead to too many parts under a high data ingestion rate. Thanks to @lujiajing1126 for [the fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5447).
* BUGFIX: properly stop execution of aborted query when the query doesn't contain [`_stream` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream-filter). Previously, such a query could continue consuming resources after being aborted by the client. Thanks to @z-anshun for [the fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5400).

## [v0.4.2](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.4.2-victorialogs)

Released at 2023-11-15

* BUGFIX: properly locate logs for the [requested streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream-filter). Previously, logs for some streams may be missing in query results. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4856). Thanks to @XLONG96 for [the fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5295)!
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): properly sort found logs by time. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5300).

## [v0.4.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.4.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2023-10-04

* BUGFIX: fix the free space verification process in VictoriaLogs that was erroneously shifting to read-only mode, despite there being sufficient free space available. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5112) issue.

## [v0.4.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.4.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2023-10-03

* FEATURE: add `-elasticsearch.version` command-line flag, which can be used for specifying the Elasticsearch version returned by VictoriaLogs to Filebeat at the [Elasticsearch bulk API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#elasticsearch-bulk-api). This helps resolve [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4777).
* FEATURE: expose the following metrics at [/metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#monitoring) page:
  * `vl_data_size_bytes{type="storage"}` - on-disk size for data excluding [log stream](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) indexes.
  * `vl_data_size_bytes{type="indexdb"}` - on-disk size for [log stream](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) indexes.
* FEATURE: add `-insert.maxFieldsPerLine` command-line flag, which can be used for limiting the number of fields per line in logs sent to VictoriaLogs via ingestion protocols. This helps avoid issues like [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/397).
* FEATURE: expose `vl_http_request_duration_seconds` histogram at the [/metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#monitoring) page. Thanks to @crossoverJie for [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/4934).
* FEATURE: add support for the `-storage.minFreeDiskSpaceBytes` command-line flag to allow switching to read-only mode when running out of disk space at `-storageDataPath`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4737).

* BUGFIX: fix possible panic when no data is written to VictoriaLogs for a long time. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4895). Thanks to @crossoverJie for filing and fixing the issue.
* BUGFIX: add `/insert/loki/ready` endpoint, which is used by Promtail for health checks. This should remove `unsupported path requested: /insert/loki/ready` warning logs. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/397#issuecomment-3043613610).
* BUGFIX: prevent panic during background merge when the number of columns in the resulting block exceeds the maximum allowed number of columns per block. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/397).

## [v0.3.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.3.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2023-07-20

* FEATURE: add support for data ingestion via Promtail (aka default log shipper for Grafana Loki). See [these](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/promtail/) and [these](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#loki-json-api) docs.

## [v0.2.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.2.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2023-07-17

* FEATURE: support short form of `_time` filters over the last X minutes/hours/days/etc. For example, `_time:5m` is a short form for `_time:(now-5m, now]`, which matches logs with [timestamps](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field) for the last 5 minutes. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter) for details.
* FEATURE: add ability to specify offset for the selected time range. For example, `_time:5m offset 1h` is equivalent to `_time:(now-5m-1h, now-1h]`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter) for details.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): replace `exact_prefix("...")` with `exact("..."*)`. This makes it consistent with [i()](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#case-insensitive-filter) filter, which can accept phrases and prefixes, e.g. `i("phrase")` and `i("phrase"*)`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#exact-prefix-filter).
